The study provides insights into how the public perceives the impact of animal agriculture on climate change based on Reddit discussions. The Reddit discussions analyzed revealed a growing interest in and positive attitudes towards animal agriculture and climate change among the Reddit community over the years. The key themes identified in the discussions suggest that the public is concerned about the role of animals in the industry, the impact of meat and dairy consumption on the environment and animal welfare,
the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the environmental impact of animal agriculture, and the societal impact of the industry. These findings can inform policies and practices that aim to address the environmental impact of animal agriculture and promote more sustainable practices in the industry.
