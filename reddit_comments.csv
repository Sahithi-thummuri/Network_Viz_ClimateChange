1,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"Just got back from a climate change keynote Re: just this that you are talking about. Models show we have 4 years for all of us to turn vegan otherwise we won’t ever end climate change. Like ever. It will be beyond our control. If we do hit the 4 year goal, it will take 39 years to reverse the affects. It will be 39 years of hellish heat, powerful storms and more even if we stop today eating meat. We’ve already fucked the next generation and possibly all future generations. The push to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels is not the full story. That has to be done very very slowly because CO2 heats the atmosphere but phosphorus cools it down. Best model is to slowly reduce burning but quickly increase veganism. Check out https://climatehealers.org. To answer your question - I have low hopes for humanity on this one. We couldn’t even unite against COVID.",6,id0np55,1655694221,
2,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"If we can get animal welfare regulations then that can both reduce the severity of the harm and the supply (which also will reduce emissions). Unfortunately, even though welfare regulations are popular it's fighting a concentrated interest which makes it even harder. Even though I'm pessimistic on this it's still worth trying.

And even if we get regulations through in one country, that still doesn't help animals or the emissions other countries. And if we try to apply pressure they will resist and call us hypocrites for eating animals for so long.

I'm much more optimistic on alternative products overtaking animal products because they don't have these problems. They will eventually become tastier and cheaper than animal products because they require far less energy, water and land, so people will switch voluntarily. I know it's sad that most people won't switch until it's in their direct self-interest, but it's the way it is. It will also take some time so other avenues must be pursued at the same time to save as many animals as possible.",3,id0lz0e,1655693246,
3,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,Let's be real. People are fucking idiots.

Jeff Bezos gets to eat X, Elon Musk gets to do Y, Bill Gates travels to Z.”  And so on down the line.

6,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,">My question is- how? How do we get there? Do you believe there is any hope for this goal of ending factory farming sooner rather than later for the sake of mitigation of climate change and environmental destruction?

No, and even it were possible it wouldn't be enough to stop the coming climate catastrophe. The writing is already on the wall. Anything we do will just be damage control",2,id0sv8p,1655697316,
7,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"If climate change leads to increased meat prices it should lead to people having an increasingly plant based diet. But not necessarily to a moral change. Probably leads to fewer animals in production but not necessarily an increase in welfare for the animals that remain.

American cow factories appear to release less co2 per cow than current grass and soy outdoor farming so I think that there will be an attempt to create indoor animal farms with carbon capture.

Edit deleted some nonsense about co2 that might work for power stations.",2,id12jzr,1655704021,
8,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"The authority on climate change IPCC has flat out said we need the planet eating a plant based diet by 2030 if we want to survive climate change.

Thanks to these reports I've seen a lot of science based channels such as Just Have a Think and Undecided with Matt Farrel take on plant based diets. Sure it's not exactly vegan for the animals, the effect is 95% the same.",2,id18245,1655708438,
9,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"The majority will never give up eating meat.

When the plant based meat alternatives are good enough and cheap enough, that will be the biggest food game-changer in our lifetimes. Billions will gradually start eating vegan, without really knowing.  But this will only really happen, once the alternatives are near enough indistinguishable or close enough that the majority are satisfied 

And when it happens, it will happen over a fairly quick time frame. I'd say over a 3-5 year timescale, where  much of the meat industry pivots towards these cheaper alternatives.

https://www.labiotech.eu/in-depth/cultured-meat-industry/

Question is, when will the alternatives be good enough?  3 years from now or 5+ years?  The climate crisis will definitely fast-track this process, but will it come soon enough? 

That's the question",2,id1k49n,1655719383,
10,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"Humans have become domesticated and lost their ability to exist without the technoeconomic structure of industrialization despite it's inherent process of displacing and abandoning them. 

Everyone should read the work of Wendell Berry, who has in my opinion the most complete picture of reality who's only Blindspot is in fact veganism. He comes so close frequently in his work, even going so far as to conclude the use of animals for labor created the necessary psychological conditions that lead to human slavery, but I digress. 

What has to be done in my opinion is for people to begin walking away from their governments entirely, leaving them behind like an abusive relationship and begin living simply off the land employing methods of planting that heal the soil, and building their communities using earth based and bushcraft building techniques. A vegan version of the Amish in simplified terms. As long as we are held in bondage by the industrialized world by way of turning it's toxic commodities into needs, and as long as we are participating in elections that solely propose an industrialized way of life, we are participating in our destruction. 

If we as a society have the knowledge to provide for ourselves by entering into a cycle of reciprocal exchange with nature, we're no longer consumers of industrial products, and we're no longer tax payers funding the death cult of industrial economies.",2,id3tdam,1655759688,
11,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"I think we'll be fine, if you take green energy as an example: despite all of the bickering in the media and social media, the experts ran the numbers and it's cheaper generate power with renewables, and tax incentives help too.

It's happening with cars too. Electric vehicles have a bigger profit margins.

Once Tyson meats is growing lab grown steak at a cheaper rate then farmers are basically out of business overnight. And that will happen according to economists before 2030. I have it marked on my calendar as the end of animal agriculture haha.

The masses while loud have very little influence thankfully. They'll continue to argue about it with out even knowing they just took a bite of lab grown flesh. The industry does what makes money and knows how to spin it.

Also there's heaps of tech, although needs to be upscaled that will sequester carbon, and that should make up for any minor groups not playing green. 

I have super low opinion of the average person if you cant already tell lol ... but I did an experiment on r/parenting I asked what do people care about more, their own children, or bacon(due to climate change).  Many complained about it being a dumb comparison. Some claimed it was biased research.But not a single person said they loved their children. Not even as a side note before complaining about my question lol. Yeah, thank god that we aren't reliant on the average person to write policies and tech direction.


Having read How To Survive a Pandemic  I feel like that is a more immediate threat, but which will also go away with lab grown meat. I feel like it'll be close, but ultimately all good once it all falls into place.",3,id18vuf,1655709130,
12,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"Wow, thanks for this answer. God, the data is startling/ scary. It’s very easy to feel hopeless but I would feel even more hopeless if I wasn’t vegan/ didn’t fight for animals.",2,id0o7m6,1655694514,
13,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"If I have the correct report https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/chapter-5

Their plant based diet includes a flexitarian option of 75% reduction of current meat eating and significant increase in plant protein.

Also that report would continue to push people from cows towards pigs and poultry.

First world reduction in meat eating is a good thing but does not make the world more vegan.


Edit to add. It does sustain an argument that while this report is complicated if you adopt a vegan diet then you are eating in a way that mitigates against climate change and this report does measure a vegan diet with a full range of nutrients. Diets that led to malnutrition were excluded.",1,id1hjmu,1655717040,
14,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"I agree entirely- overthrowing the chains of capitalism does seem to be the only answer, but how to get people to learn to provide for themselves naturally in a warming world-  it just seems like a catch 22. To mitigate climate change we have to live simply and in communion with the land, but to do that you need healthy water, soil and air, and climate change is making all of that less common/ accessible. 

random, but I once read an excellent book on technological tyranny called “The Technological Society” by Jacques Ellul. It talks about the threat to freedom created by modern technology and technique, the rationality of which enforces logical and mechanical organization through division of labor, the setting of production standards, etc. This artificial system “eliminates or subordinates the natural world”. While the book is mainly human-focused, it could be insightful into how technology affects our relationship with the environment and animals too.

18,Will the climate crisis lead to an early vegan societal shift?,"I'll check out that book. I used to be somewhat of a Marxist, and so I cought on your comment of overthrowing capitalism. I've come to the conclusion that both capitalism and socialism are branches of industrialization, both are systems of obfuscation that hold the concept of local sustainable economies in contempt and instead propose global economies reliant of the specialization of labor. Both hold onto the supernatural belief that science and technology will be able to be the solution to the very problems said technology and science creates. Both erode the skills of human being required to actually produce necessities on the individual and communal scale. 

I actually found Wendell after becoming disenchanted with communism and searching for anyone who actually addresses man's relationship with technology and specialized labor. I'd recommend starting with either ""the unsettling of America"" or ""the world ending fire"".

Otherwise we have a dedicated vegetarian/vegan base and other people scoffing at options they don’t consider viable. We should encourage a cultural shift.

But you are missing the point. These graphs don't take full production lifecycle into account. In terms of carbon footprint you should first focus on what you eat then where it comes from/how it's transported.

Animal product carbon footprint significantly outweighs the carbon footprint of plant products even when you take shipping and transport into account.

And it is significant by any metric of comparison, kcal by kcal, gram by gram, gram of protein by gram of protein. You will invariably reduce your carbon footprint by ditching animal products.

I had seen a few earlier posts suggesting everyone start hunting now, so I am trigger happy to destroy that idea with logic right from the get to. 

I grew up hunting, and in a heavy duty hunting culture, so I get where you are coming from. You are correct that it (eating meat obsession) has spiraled out of control. In the days of ""little house on the prarie,"" people ate meat once a week if that. most folks lived on beans.  the lack of refrigerators probably contributed to that. Regardless, flesh was a luxury item, not a 3x per day necessity. 

what I cannot fathom, is the sheer numbers. there have only been 100 billion people,  ever, as in the history of the planet. Now, there are 8 billion humans chopping down the amazon at an alarming pace, and forcing a massive wild animal extinction (70% decrease since the 70's - or something like that, I forget the stat), to make room to raise the 85 BILLION land animals PER YEAR for slaughter. 

A. There simply is not enough water for this. 

B. It will take a few decades of eliminating animal agriculture, adjusting peoples' diets,  and regrowing wild animal populations before hunting wont destroy  everything in a heartbeat.

No this was never said and you're strawmanning. We need to massively reduce animal agriculture. Like why are you so attached to animal agriculture? It's objectively worse than plant agriculture in so many ways. 

Animal agriculture is the number one destroyer of ecosystems, leading cause of species extinction and deforestation worldwide. Its is the leading cause of ocean deadzones and water pollution/eutrophication. Its horribly cruel on top of all of that.

Anything bad you say about crop agriculture is already multiplied by animal agriculture since we would have a net reduction in crop agriculture if we didn't have to grow feed for animal. 

And there's many other reasons to abolish this industry. Zoonotic diseases are one major one. We didn't learn anything from covid 19.

>Does the 15 minutes of taste justify the cruelty involved?

For me yes. I also find it a natural thing and i consider myself part of nature, an animal, so to speak. But this is an ethical argument  which is way different with what you wrote before trying to bring in (fake) objectivity. I' more than happy to discuss ethics. I have 0 tolerance against fake news.
Edit: i want to further add something. I do not condone animal abuse before killing. I am also a conservationist and there are species who must not be hunted. (Also high intelligence species, especially if they have long life span). This is my standard, at least.


>Could you show us the math? 

I don't know the name of the law in english, but i suppose it is the law of marginal X increases.

In short you may know it as the law that expresses marginal costs.
It basically tells us that major cuts are all that makes the difference. For example reducing meat consumption by 90 % is more impactfult than reducing the remaining part by further 90%. As in first steps are what matters the most. In short between eating 0kg of meat per year and eating like 7kg per year changes practically nothing.
Even if correlation is linear you can have a maximum output to balance out with carbon subtraction (aka trees). Such amount would be greater than 0

The other law at play here is the theorem of existence of zeroes, but that isn't guaranteed to exist for this case.

One could argue the rules of predator/prey dynamics should be considered as well. But that involves considering humans predators and the lack of other major predators. This would be less relevant anyway.

The first law is what matters the most.

>Feel free to offer specifics.

It's in the paper/document you linked. They talk how xombining 5 major practices can keep us below 1.5

I think you're referring to the law of diminishing returns. It doesn't apply here. If you halve your animal product consumption you reduce impact to the planet by x. If you completely remove it you reduce it by 2x. It is proportional. You'd need to provide a source to show any sort of exponentials here because logically that makes no sense.

>You'd need to provide a source to show any sort of exponentials here because logically that makes no sense. 


I have no source to provide exponentials, but it was an analogy to make you understand what i mean.
Except forests being better carbon sinks than single trees summed together. Therefore deforestation can be addressed under nonlinear points of view. Forests vs crops, if you prefer.

As i said given that there are carbon sinks there will be a net 0. Such net 0 means that emissions are evened by subtractions. Which makes emissions a positive amount, not 0.

Now the important thing is reaching this threshhold (which can be quantified) and that's why reducing by 90% is more important than reducing by 99% (it's an example, i don't know the exact amount this threshold belongs to.)

Edit: you got me interested, so i looked it up further.

It appears that warming is precisely nonlinear, or at least, there are studies in that sense. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1501923

>Therefore deforestation can be addressed under nonlinear points of view

No it can't. If you draw this on a graph you don't get exponential growth you get linear growth. 100 trees will have 100x the carbon sink of one tree. 50 trees will have 50x and 1000 trees will have 1000x. It's a proportional relationship.

And besides I think it's fair to assume with this statement you're opposed to intensive factory farming? Well st the moment 90% of animals are raised in factory farms. This number is not going to go down. It is not possible to feed a world population meat without factory farming. We do not have enough and on this planet to raise all grazing animals.

Sigh. I should get offended as your answers imply i'm stupid.

If we reduce meat production by 90% and then linearly we reduce surface covered by crops (for feed) by 90% and then we return such ground to forests we are changing the net emissions of the process. Not the net emissions of farming, but of farmig vs afforestation.

I said no already, i'm a conservationist.

My point is that everyone draws their line. We should draw a conventionqlly accepted line, but understand that such line is not the same for everyone. We also should accept that killing is part of nature and be able to accept different moralities of different people. As long as such different moralities don't harm other people (the only ones who talk about moraliry anyway), then killing is fine. What i am saying is that it's not obvious that ""no killing"" is the rule. Also because everyone of us regularly kills. Walking, even eating only vegan food does still leave a trail of death. (Bugs, pests). Sure the number of deaths increases if you eat meat. But the path of minor bloodshed is a choice, not a universal rule.

>In a world where 90% meat consumption goes down I guarantee people would realise they don't miss it and it's nit worth the sacrifice of the animal.

Yes. And most reasonable people draw the line saying no injustice. Not injustice 10% of the time. People want an end to it.

Rape is a part of nature. Should we jus accept that? Or should we acknowledge it's wrong and not contribute to it? What about people who are OK with rape? What about cultures against homosexuality or women's rights? Should we just accept them? Or should we stand up and say they're wrong? 

But you're saying you're OK with killing animals? But only some animals right? Like I can kill a dog or a pig but not a tiger. Do you think it's any different from the animals point of view? And you mentioned earlier you don't want them to suffer. You want them to be happy. Why? If you consider their life to be worth so little that you're OK with killing them for a burger when you could equally eat a very tasty plant based burger, then why care about them at all? This is inconsistent. 

>Walking, even eating only vegan food does still leave a trail of death

You already answered this point. Veganism reduces the amount of suffering we cause as much as practicable and possible. Just because you can't cause no suffering that doesn't mean you should case massive amounts carelessly. 

Look, aiming for 90% is silly. It's like saying we want 90% less murder. We want 100% less murder. Even if that goal is unobtainable that doesn't mean we should compromise and aim any lower. And it doesn't mean 90% reduction isn't a good thing.

To out it another way if you say the goal is to reduce consumption then if we reach that goal people will feel like they've done their job. But there's still injustice in this system. If we say we want 100% reduction and get 90% then people still keep moving towards that goal even when they reach 90%.

Brcause you can just reduce animal agriculture, without completely forbidding it and still save ecosystems. It's as simple as that.

So who doesn't is unreasonable. I see i see. Quite an entitled opinion, as in ""who thinks like me is reasonable, who doesn't is not reasonable""... however.

>Or should we stand up and say they're wrong? 

I say we she should stand up and say they are wrong, but this is still an opinion. Just it is an opinion i agree with. Point is rape involves other humans. And i value humans more than i value non human animals.

>Do you think it's any different from the animals point of view? 

I don't care of the animals point of view. I care only about the human point of view. That's why you can kill and eat a dog, but you can't kill ""my"" dog. That's why you can kill a cow, but not an orangutan or a dolphin. It's me, the human, who decides, not them.

>This is inconsistent. 

It's a case by case evaluation, not inconsistent.. at maximum inefficient.

>Just because you can't cause no suffering that doesn't mean you should case massive amounts carelessly. 

That is a choice and an opinion. Specifically an opinion i do not share.


>Look, aiming for 90% is silly. It's like saying we want 90% less murder.

First you accuse me of strawmanning, then you pull a strawman on me.

The point is that 10% of murder still affects people.
10% of animal agriculture won't affect the environment, climate crisis and human lives. So they are different scenarios. Of course for who cares about animal lives it's the same thing, but it isn't so for others.

I am aware. Killing animals is not injustice for me tho. That's the difference. I know it is for you, that's why you make the comparison in the first place, but you need to understand it is an opinion. Furthermore we do not judge predators for hunting prey, we shouldn't judge people who eat animals. At least not  in absolute ways.

>An oppressor doesn't get to say what about of damage is ok.

That's true, yet seeing humans as oppressors to animals, who do not have morality and cannot define oppressors, only predators, is an opinion, not a fact. (Also notice that all animals can be ""oppressors"".) Just to be clear it is an opinion that i consider valid and respect, but do not share.

>You don't need to value non humans the same amount as humans to believe they deserve to be treated with moral consideration. 

You are right, i need to value their lives more than i value their taste, which i ""generally"" don't, but sometimes (specific scenarios) do.

>Right?

Killing my dog, you are damaging me. That is the difference, because it is ""my"" dog, ""my"" companion. It's related to a human.

>What is the moral difference between a pig and an orangutan?

For me it is intelligence (both sapience and sentience, not only sentience) as well as extinction threat. Of course i wouldn't eat a pig that is someone's pig, same as the dog before.

Edit: i want to specify that the whole process of pig killing is something i do not support. Just kill them with a shot in the head or other ""minimal pain"" proceedings.

Animals are obligate carnivores/omnivores. They need to do it to survive. We do not. And as I've already mentioned they also rape each other. They kill their young too. We do not use animals as a moral guide.

And i respect that. There is also the concept of socially decided norms, wich supersede (overwrite) relative opinions. As a matter of fact life of animals being a priority over taste is not one of these norms.

>Can I kill them?

Not for me, not for society. Because they are humans we already enstabilished that we do not kill humans by default. (It's our socially accepted rule, which doesn't discern between different humans)
This said it is one of the distinguishing factors for me and my own judgment over what to kill or not to kill. Like it or not, it's one of my reasons. 



>Why bother is the animal isn't important? 

Because for me taste is more important than animal lige, but less important than the animals quality of life before death. Death is not something to renounce to, but pointless suffering meanwhile is. Different people may not agree. In short pain is not needed to eat the animal, however their death is.

> If Unnecessary suffering is not an injustice then nothing is. 

Welcome to truth. Injustice is subjective because we are not gods. We can't define precisely justice or injustice, that is we make laws, to attempt to reavh these concepts. We can have a socially accepted justice or injustice, but not an abaolute one. The closest thing to justice is unanimously agreed upon laws.

>We are moral actors, they are not.

I agree. Since animals can't morally decide, then we should be very careful on what we decide, as it comes from our perspective alone.",1,iwkht55,1668587050,

I've discussed quite a bit at r/debateavegan and even though I value the science behind all this a huge lot (it's personally my biggest reason to go big on reducetarianism) I'm fairly sure it's not the main reasoning behind veganism.

Also it's good to keep in mind that there are lots of non-vegan things related to sustainable consumption - land use applies even to vegan nutrition, and then there's food waste, overconsumption and e.g mollusks are very low impact and can possibly even be carbon negative according to some research. Especially issues related to land use are still quite tricky when it comes to assessing impact on a product-basis and consideration of land use is often omitted in assessments. But of course the general trend is clear - more vegan nutrition is better. My point is simply that there are lots and lots of details under the big picture and that even vegans can always improve their sustainability (by considering product impact, food waste and land use issues foremost).",4,hq98k7i,1640680147,

You just broke my brain.  Are you in the USA?  In the USA it'd be very odd to self describe as conservative, vegan, and pro-environment.  Even outside the USA to be vegan is not to be conservative since vegans believe drastic change is needed in a great many sectors.  In fact I've a hard time imagining something vegans want to remain the same.  Perhaps we just understand these words differently?  Perhaps by ""conservative"" you mean what I might mean be ""libertarian"".  Whatever.

>Your housing example here sounds interesting. I’d be interesting in hearing more about that, and if you would have any ideas on how to organize to make that become a reality some day

There's not much more to tell, other than the basic concept.  It's possible to well soundproof rooms so that residents in multifamily complexes won't hear each other.  A person is only making full use of one room at a time.  It's logical then to design such as to minimize exclusively owned space.

So long as the ~30-60 residents wouldn't mind sharing spaces to be maintained and cleaned by management such as bathrooms and kitchens (much as smaller families do) this frees up a great amount of floorspace that might then be put to more efficient use.  Such a development could feature superior furnishings and amenities or return the space savings to residents in the form of less expensive housing.

I've been trying to raise interest in such a development but have had no luck.  I can't find a builder interested in pursuing the idea.  I can find architects willing to craft prints but I didn't get the impression they had much faith in the project.  I don't have enough money to fund it all myself and so it's necessary to persuade others to the merits of the proposal so as to secure additional funding and finding a builder is part of that.

However were a group of 20 or so vegans to get together and decide they wanted to live together in such a modern SRO and each put a small amount aside in an escrow account created to evidence their sincerity that'd make it easy to get whatever necessary remaining financing.  Get enough vegans to opt in and no additional loans would even be necessary, which would be ideal.  Given financing a major design build firm might be hired once you've acquired a suitable piece of land.

Finding a suitable piece of land is hard in the USA because of odious code.  Like I said in most places what I describe is illegal.  But there are places... finding a good piece of land is something you'd want to consult a local expert over.  Sadly realtors don't typically deal in multifamily acquisitions and are of a hostile politic  so you'd probably want to find a local builder or developer, maybe someone into green building, maybe a student fresh out of a grad school related program.  These are treacherous waters.  With a good group going in hopefully you'd have someone who knows how to proceed better than I.

Get the money, get the land, hire a design-build firm.  If you can check all those boxes the only thing I'd say you should insist on is that the top floor be entirely share space and that it feature a patio roof.  It's rare for multifamily developments to set aside an entire floor as share space, it's something only bigger hotels sometimes do.  But the idea is to deliver a superior living experience despite drastically reducing exclusively owned space and you don't do that by cutting corners.  Also the share space ought to be on the top floor because that way you eliminate unwanted and distracting through traffic.  Everybody in the share space means to be in the share space.  Whereas if shared spaces are elsewhere people will be walking through those areas not meaning to stop there, which decreases their appeal.  It'd be like having the front door open into the living room, it'd make the living room a worse place to hang out with all the coming and going.  The share space would feature many private rooms but still, better to segregate it from incident traffic.  

The patio roof is a big deal because it's a great place to chill and read or have coffee and also because it allows for pets.  For example residents could home their cats on the top shared floor and allow them free run of that space along with a ramp that leads to a pet door that opens onto the patio roof.  Then pets could go outside without harming local wildlife and residents could have pets when otherwise it'd be prohibitive given their tiny rooms.  Provided ventilation is superior and the space kept clean allergies shouldn't be an issue... or if that would be an issue it'd be something to decide going in.

An elevator is a good idea, it should run from the subfloor bike garage to the top patio roof.  Not sure about kitchens; I'm partial to the ground floor featuring a restaurant and there otherwise being no kitchens since I don't think it's efficient for residents to privately cook but floors could each feature a kitchen area.  I think if each unit had a mini fridge and water cooler that'd be sufficient.

But this is stuff the group and architect would decide for themselves.  I've my opinions but the main thing is just to minimize personal exclusively owned space to maximize useful space available to residents and to return the savings in ways they'd appreciate more than otherwise underutilized personal spaces.",1,hqcuf94,1640743096,

I do view other animals as equal, morally speaking.

>	The two big ones being our intellect and our concept of morality make us utterly unique in the animal kingdom. Apes do come close in some ways but ultimately fall short.

We differ in degree of intelligence, but not in kind - degree of intelligence is arbitrary, and morally irrelevant. 

To be clear, we are not establishing a meta-ethical framework, rather we are working from the basis that you have already established (discussed further down). This comes down to consistency. Most people view it as even more immoral to exploit humans of lesser cognitive capacity or developed intelligence (children, mentally disabled, etc.), because their vulnerability and innocence is being taken advantage of. 

Do you deem intelligence as relevant to the moral worth of a human? That is to say, would you deem a human of low intelligence as being morally inferior, or vice versa? If not, then it’s logically inconsistent to do so in the case of other animals. 

>	There you go using that language again. Make up your mind, are they equitable or not?

I was responding to your assertion that animals should be treated “more humanely”

Objectively speaking, there is nothing our body requires which is exclusive to animal products, and cannot be derived elsewhere.

1) In the egg industry, male chicks are ground up/macerated alive because they don’t produce eggs, and they are not as profitable of a breed in terms of their flesh. Chickens used for their eggs have been selectively bred to produce over 20 times the amount of eggs they would otherwise naturally produce, whereas chickens used for their flesh have been selectively bred to grow much larger and much faster than they otherwise naturally would. 

2) In the dairy industry, cows are forcibly impregnated year after year, to keep them lactating (they produce milk when they have babies, for their babies, like humans and all other mammals) and produce offspring who can be exploited as well - the male calves are typically killed as soon as they are born, for the same reason male chicks are killed in the egg industry (male calves don’t produce milk). 

3) Every one of these animals are killed at a fraction of their lifespan, as soon as they begin to produce less milk, or fewer eggs than what is deemed economically viable. 

The issue here is not how they are treated, rather, the core issue is that they are exploited, period. They are being denied their basic moral right to bodily liberty. Their moral rights are not being respected.

>	Because we’re the only species on the planet that understands what morality is. Applying said morality to things that have no concept of it can be understood to a point, but certainly not as far as you think.

If you are going to apply this logic, you must apply it consistently. Do you think a dog holds moral value, and deserves moral consideration, despite their lack of moral agency (mind you, pigs can reciprocate compassion and love just as a dog can, given the same circumstances of being in a loving home)? A cat? A small child, or a mentally disabled human?

Just because someone cannot comprehend and act on our moral basis, it doesn’t follow that we have carte blanche to use them as means to an end. For example, I don’t expect a small child or a mentally disabled human to reciprocate and uphold moral responsibility, however, they deserve baseline moral consideration all the same. If anything, we consider their innocence and vulnerability as an additional reason to protect their interest. To reverse this logic, and cite the innocence and vulnerability of nonhuman animals as supposed license to exploit them needlessly, is objectively logically inconsistent, and hypocritical.

Now, there are notable differences between humans and other animals, however, these differences are of no relevance to one’s moral worth. You do make a good point, in that we have moral agency, whereas nonhuman animals do not. We have the ability to rationalize our decisions based on notion of right and wrong, in ways and to degree of which far exceeds that of nonhuman animals (in part due to the educational foundation that we are provided, which is a privilege), and this is relevant in the sense that moral agency entails moral obligations which cannot be reasonably expected of those who do not have moral agency - moreover, with moral agency comes certain rights or privileges which are not afforded to say, nonhuman animals, small children, the mentally disabled, etc. (e.g. the right to drive a car, or the right to vote).

In the case of nonhuman animals, we are talking about equal consideration relative to similar interests. That is to say, while a pig has no interest in voting, they do have an interest in bodily integrity. There are certain universal capacities and interests amongst not only humans, but all sentient beings, which must be considered as it pertains to establishing moral baseline - capacity to feel and experience subjectively, capacity to suffer, interest in bodily liberty, interest in living, and preference to avoid pain, suffering, and death. Every reason as to why humans deserve moral consideration is just as applicable to nonhuman animals, and as such, whatever moral baseline is established, nonhuman animals sit comfortably atop of it (whether this is acknowledged and/or respected or not). The moral baseline that has been established is compromised of the moral right to not be treated as property; the moral right to not be treated as a resource to exploit; the moral right to be treated not as a means to a human end, but rather as an end in and of one’s own moral right. 

If someone is attempting to harm you, then you have every right to defend yourself, however, these animals have done nothing to you.

I think you highlighted exactly why we do have a moral obligation to be vegan. We do have moral agency, and moral obligations, which cannot be expected of other animals. In the case of nonhuman animals, what matters is not whether they can reason like us, but rather whether they can suffer.

With great knowledge comes great responsibility, and being vegan is frankly the bear minimum we can do. Stopping your oppression of others is the moral baseline; that is to say, veganism is the moral baseline. The next step is speaking up on behalf of the oppressed.",3,hqgbqud,1640809171,

A pneumatic spike that goes through the brain is cruel, whether or not you're eating them after has absolutely no bearing on whether or not it is cruel.

It's really not how you kill them, would you object to me killing you if I was to do it like that? Or would you prefer to just not die? It's the killing that's immoral, not the how. **Killing someone that does not want or need to die is immoral.**

So I presume in order to be consistent with this, you don't own a pet as that would a form of slavery, and that you stop on the side of the road to give funeral rites to roadkill animals? Or do only animals that we exploit have moral weight?

>Do you deem intelligence as relevant to the moral worth of a human?

You asked in what way(s) are we superior to animals. Even the dumbest of humans is still more intelligent of animals, and in particular children will grow to be more intelligent as time goes on. Intelligence is not ""arbitrary"" just because other animals have a modicum of it. It is a quality that allowed mankind to dominate the planet when our physical attributes should have deemed us evolutionary failures. The sheer amount of it we possess in comparison makes us superior. But no, I don't consider intelligence to be a marker of worth in a human. A human is valuable because they are human.

>Objectively speaking, there is nothing our body requires which is exclusive to animal products, and cannot be derived elsewhere.

Fair, and there is an argument that can be made for not using animal products. Ethics in terms of an animals value is not one of them.

>1) In the egg industry, male chicks are ground up/macerated alive because they don’t produce eggs, and they are not as profitable of a breed in terms of their flesh. Chickens used for their eggs have been selectively bred to produce over 20 times the amount of eggs they would otherwise naturally produce, whereas chickens used for their flesh have been selectively bred to grow much larger and much faster than they otherwise naturally would. 

So what? As long as they're allowed to live normally before being killed quickly and painlessly it doesn't matter. 

>2) In the dairy industry, cows are forcibly impregnated year after year, to keep them lactating (they produce milk when they have babies, for their babies, like humans and all other mammals) and produce offspring who can be exploited as well - the male calves are typically killed as soon as they are born, for the same reason male chicks are killed in the egg industry (male calves don’t produce milk).

Again so what. The point is that these animals do not suffer. If they do, then we can find a way to do it such that they do not.

>3) Every one of these animals are killed at a fraction of their lifespan, as soon as they begin to produce less milk, or fewer eggs than what is deemed economically viable. 

This I can agree on, animals should be allowed to live their lifespan.

>They are being denied their basic moral right to bodily liberty. Their moral rights are not being respected.

They have none. If you seek to derive morality and rights from nature, there is no way you could conclude animals have such rights. The only other source of morality is a third party(god), and I don't know a single deity that says much beyond forbidding a certain animal or telling us to be good stewards of what we rule.

>If you are going to apply this logic, you must apply it consistently. Do you think a dog holds moral value, and deserves moral consideration, despite their of moral agency

You're shifting the question. I am not talking about moral agency. I'm talking about the ability to understand morality in the first place. Not make moral choices. 

>it doesn’t follow that we have carte blanche to use them as means to an end.

Never said that. I have said that we should treat animals as kindly as possible while still exploiting them.

>I don’t expect a small child or a mentally disabled human to reciprocate and uphold moral responsibility,

Again not the question. It's not about upholding moral responsibility. It's about understanding what morality is in the first place. But in any case a child can be taught right from wrong, and my mother works with disabled kids. They can learn just as well when taught patiently. 

> To reverse this logic, and cite the innocence and vulnerability of nonhuman animals as supposed license to exploit them needlessly, is objectively logically inconsistent, and hypocritical.

You're applying human standards to animals and it's inconsistent. You seem to forget that no animal is ""innocent and vulnerable"" the way you describe. A cow can and will kill you, just like most any livestock.  They wouldn't even understand what they had done. 

>Now, there are notable differences between humans and other animals, however, these differences are of no relevance to one’s moral worth

They absolutely do. There is no basis for an animal having moral worth. Not in nature, and not in any religious sense beyond the cow in India.

Dude just because you want to take a moral system humans have and apply it to animals doesn't mean  it's logically sound.

Death being dealt does not mean that cruelty is applied. As a human example, look at the Geneva conventions. They ban ""cruel"" weapons because they know that a bullet more often than not is a quick Death. Cruelty is when needless suffering is inflicted.

You say you're not equating a cows life to a human life but you keep using language that tells me you are. If they are not equitable then applying our standards of morality to them makes no sense. 

>Dogs don't have moral agency, humans do. When a human mounts a dog we absolutely punish them because that's sexually abusive. And since it's humans shoving their fists up cows or an electrified rod to force them to ejaculate, that is sexually abusive in the same way.

Okay so we agree here that humans have moral agency. The reason we punish bestiality is because the physical act can harm the animal(not to mention the general moral degeneracy surrounding the act), and the act is very much centered around the pleasure the human derives from it. The reason tools are used on cattle to stimulate ejaculation is because that's a medical procedure in order to breed a new litter of offspring. Not because a farmer enjoys doing it, and no injury is sustained by the cattle. These things are not equitable.

>See my previous point, by this logic it's okay for me to kill animals and eat them because lions do. No. Nature is not a moral standard humans should be striving to emulate, nature is cruel, violent and absolutely horrific for most involved. 

Okay here's something interesting then. If nature is not the place to derive morality from, then the only other place one *could* derive morality is a third party, a God if you will.

This is a false dichotomy, but I will say several things. 

There are many issues with appealing to a moral authority. Firstly, religious texts can be interpreted in a variety of ways, and question arises as to whether the popular interpretation is indeed in alignment with what the alleged moral authority is truly deeming to be right or wrong. 

You claim that God is objective, but you have no reason to think this to be the case, unless you can independently verify the truth and reason supporting the moral judgements proposed by the alleged moral authority. However, given that there must be independent verification based upon logic and reason, not only would it be the case that moral authority does not resolve any moral questions, it would highlight our ability to identify what is morally right and wrong independent of the alleged moral authority. 

So, we still come back to the same question: using logic and reason, how do you justify your human supremacist mentality? That is to say, what is the *moral* difference between humans and other animals?",3,hqh6ky2,1640821394,

You can say that, but doesn't mean it's true. Where else could humanity derive morality from? Nature or a third party are the only two places it could be in order for morality to be an objective standard from which societies can then be formed. 

>how do you justify your human supremacist mentality? That is to say, what is the moral difference between humans and other animals?

You are evading the question I asked. What traits do humans have which distinguish us from other animals, morally speaking? 

Why would one’s ability to reason define one’s moral worth? It’s not enough to simply say that other animals are morally inferior because they don’t have the capacity to reason at our level, or understand moral concept - there must be logic and reason such a statement follows, and this logic and reason must be consistently applicable regardless of the species in question (that is, including humans). 

I sincerely doubt you apply this logic to dogs and cats, seeing as you dodged my earlier question regarding just that. 

Moreover, in setting standards that conveniently gatekeep nonhuman animals from the moral community without offering any justification for why these standards are appropriate, you are barring many humans in the process - toddlers and severely mentally disabled humans don’t have capacity to understand or solve complex moral issues, and before you state that severely mentally disabled humans can be taught if patient enough (some cannot be taught..) - pigs can be taught that certain actions are right or wrong, given enough “patience” as well, however, that doesn’t mean the pig has a grasp of moral concept or the capacity to solve complex moral issues. Yet, whilst you apply these yet to be justified standards for a pig, you don’t apply these standards in human context, which illuminates a glaring discrepancy in your belief system that rests not upon logic and reason, but rather arbitrary discrimination against other species. 

If you aren’t willing to justify your position with logic and reason, then can you really claim to even meet the standard you propose - seeking to solve complex issues of morality - or are you ironically excluding yourself from your own idea of a moral community?",1,hqkaxbd,1640882561,

I just missed it in that massive wall of text you put together. When it comes to cats and dogs, they hold about the same value as any other animal, they just fulfill different roles. It could just as easily have been other animals that fulfilled their roles, but it wasn't.

Again. If you can name a place to derive standards from that is not nature or a third party then please do so. You keep saying that my standards are ""arbitrary"" but I'm simply basing my stance on the belief that a third party(God) has dictated what is moral and what is not to us. From that basis, even the most handicapped of humans has moral value simply because they are human. An animal does not have that same value.

Moral traits would be capacity to feel, capacity to experience subjectively, and capacity to suffer - which is essentially always coupled with an interest in living, an interest in freedom/bodily liberty, an interest in feeling pleasure, and a preference to avoid pain, suffering, and death. 

We differ from other animals in degree of cognitive capacity, but not in kind. 

>	You keep saying that my standards are “arbitrary” but I’m simply basing my stance on the belief that a third party(God) has dictated what is moral and what is not to us. From that basis, even the most handicapped of humans has moral value simply because they are human.

Thank you for being honest. You are saying that humans are morally superior simply because they are human. One’s species - or one’s physical form - is as arbitrary as skin color or sex. In the above paragraph, I mention that while we differ from other animals in degree of cognitive capacity, we do not differ in kind. 

You might say, but humans have higher intellect, and therefore other animals are morally inferior - well, degree of intelligence is arbitrary. Where do we draw the line, and what reason would we have for doing so? Why is one’s ability to reason morally relevant? 

We have already decided as a society that it is immoral to apply this logic in human context, and for good reason. It is not a good moral benchmark, and I cannot think of a good reason for suggesting this be a moral benchmark. 

If you would discriminate against a pig for their lesser cognitive capacity, but you would not discriminate against a human for having lesser cognitive capacity - this is logically inconsistent, and illustrates that you aren’t truly deeming the pig morally inferior due to their lesser cognitive capacity, but rather simply because they are a pig. How is that right? 

Species membership is arbitrary. It is not morally relevant. Why should someone be deemed morally inferior because they have fur, feathers, or scales, or because they walk on four legs and not two, or because they have wings instead of arms? 

We focus so much on how we differ on the outside, we don’t see that we are like them in so many ways. Sure, there are factors that set us apart, but those factors are not morally relevant. Nonhuman animals have an interest in living, an interest in freedom, a capacity to feel pleasure, capacity to feel pain and suffer, and a preference to avoid pain, suffering, and death - just like us. They have a beating heart, lungs or gills, a central nervous system, and a brain. They have eyes, ears, a nose, a mouth - they experience the world through these senses - just like we do.

Is it from Nature that you observe this moral equivalence? Or does a third party you have faith in impart such moral duties?

You're anthropomorphizing a great deal here. Animals have an ""interest"" in existing, not living. Their only purpose in doing so is to pass on their genes to the next generation. An ""interest"" in freedom is simply an animal desiring to get exercise or seek other food sources. They have no concept of freedom.

We attribute moral worth to one another because we can empathize - we share binding commonalities, namely the capacity to feel, experience subjectively, and suffer. We recognize that we would not want harm done to us, and we have therefore come to the conclusion that it’s wrong to deliberately inflict unnecessary harm, suffering, and death upon others who share these same capacities. 

Morality does not hinge upon religious belief, however, even in religious texts, this is explicitly explained. Do unto others as you would have done unto you. Why, though? This question has been answered; as I explained, the morally relevant qualities which preface this notion are just as applicable to nonhuman animals, thus whatever moral baseline is established, nonhuman animals sit comfortably atop of. Thus, the moral baseline is veganism. 

>	You’re anthropomorphizing

No, you just seem to believe that morally relevant qualities are unique to humans, despite all evidence pointing to the contrary. The fact that you think my attributing moral worth to other animals is anthropomorphizing is a projection of your own human supremacist mentality. 

Religion is a personal choice. Abusing animals is not. Your personal choice to hold religious belief does not grant you the right to harm other animals, anymore so than personal religious belief grants one the right to persecute homosexuals, or mutilate the genitals of children.

Right now you can't pay more for meat and be sure that that extra dollar is spent so that workers are paid a fair wage, that a carbon tax is properly offsetting any negative environment impact, that the animals are cared for in a humane way. You're very likely paying more to justify the existence of marketing firms to sell you ""guilt-free"" consumerism, and increasing profit reports for large corporations to garner more investment. 

Meat doesn't work as a cheap food for the masses. It does imo have a place eternally as a luxury food item if the cost covers its ethical impact. It also works as a a resource to maintain for times of crisis- It's extremely practical in terms of nutrients, shelf life, skills to produce. You can feed happy pigs things that are inedible to us and produce quality nutrients. They can live in a dust bowl situation. 

I'm eventually planning on writing a report on true cost for animals, but as a rough idea image what our consumption would look like in the current climate if a whole chicken was around $60 CAD, with the agriculture workers being paid enough to care, a large carbon tax funding green initiatives and paying out other countries affected by our local emissions, and funding more environmental research and government programs enforcing transparency and honesty in agriculture and nutrition.",6,hij73sd,1635526182,

I grew up in the US, where about 90 years ago, tilling up grassland used for grazing created, basically, a climate catastrophe and widespread loss of topsoil.  There’s a Ken Burns documentary about it.  It was very, very bad.  Like, Oklahoma Dust Storms reaching the eastern seaboard bad.

I agree we all need to eat less meat, though.  My partner and I eat a scant fraction of the annual Canadian average amount of beef consumed.  When I was growing up I ate more, but that was because we raised it and had it slaughtered within 30 miles of our home.  Native prairie pasture accounted for about 50% of our acreage, and alfalfa for feed playing a crucial soil regenerating role in our crop rotation (3-4 years in a 7-year rotation).  We’d also graze them on corn stubble.  Native prairies are a good carbon sink, and those ecosystems evolved with grazers.  The monster herds of bison that white settlers reported when they first moved toward the interior of North America were evidence of a major ecological imbalance, but we do need some animals on grasslands here.

I always feel some kinda way about articles like this, because obviously meat production is a very personal topic for me.  But the way I see it discussed by advocates for switching to plant-based diets always puts me on the back foot.  The 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions number comes from a UN report that was later corrected by its own author (there’s a [Conversation](https://theconversation.com/amp/yes-eating-meat-affects-the-environment-but-cows-are-not-killing-the-climate-94968) article on that here). Fruits abs vegetables are also subject to emissions through the global supply chain.  Plant-based proteins have additional costs associated with processing, and presumably bi-products that have their own ecological impacts.  Not to mention, they also increase production of commodity crops, potentially on former grassland.  A shift from corn to peas for Impossible Meat would maybe be good for soil quality (assuming the plants used to generate these products are legumes, they’re good for soil health), but there are still energy costs associated with their production, and I’m curious to see how those compare with meat.

I do think that agriculture is a vital piece in this puzzle, and that eating less meat, or abstaining, depending on personal preference, is going to be a vital part of that, especially considering animal agriculture has contributed devastatingly to deforestation in many places.  But non-farmers and non-agronomists don’t do us any favors with what appears to be a shallow understanding of farming - including the carbon cost of commodity grain and legume crops, in terms of production, fertilizers, transportation, and further processing.

In what sense is this ""taking it to the extreme,"" and why do you say this like it is a bad thing?

>the prices of vegan products are incredibly high again. 

Common vegan staples like beans, rice, lentils, bananas, and potatoes are among the most affordable foods nearly anywhere in the world.

Yes, there are some expensive products marketed towards vegans, but that doesn't mean that being vegan is expensive -- the same way that expensive lobster and caviar doesn't mean *not* being vegan is expensive.

>It's very expensive to be vegan and not everyone can afford that.

Keep in mind that being vegan is about doing what is possible and practicable. If you literally cannot afford to eat a 100% plant-based diet and can only afford to eat a 98% plant-based diet, then you can still be vegan. Now obviously this is only true if it actually is not practicable for you to eat 100% plant-based.

Not everyone can afford to eat 100% plant-based, but everyone can afford to be vegan.

>I've never met someone who was truly, long term vegan that wasn't also an asshole - that's not an argument, just personal experience.

Regardless, we will have to change our way of life, but the process must start at infrastructure if we are to transition into a far more sustainable economy.

Historically, when the Americans were called upon to ramp up production of war materials in the times preceding and during World War II, they didn't *just* ask the population to take responsibility they put down the cash and took on bids from corporations to get shit done, first, THEN began hiring a workforce to carry out that plan.

And this is of course going to result in a change in lifestyle for many people, much like World War II rationing did, but the process always started legislatively, as a collective responsibility, not an individual one.

Except we are seeing this happen, albeit very slowly. Twenty years ago, the general population thought vegans were crazy. They were some fringe group that were doing something that was seen as a daunting chore that had no real benefits.

Fast-forward to today and most people know what veganism is and tons of places have vegan options. Hell, even BURGER KING is pushing a 0% beef patty -- because they are seeing the shift in consumer demand. The even have a location in the UK that is temporarily 100% vegan to see how it goes.

Many pizza companies are offering plant-based cheese, something that barely even existed a few decades ago. The American Egg Board has actually admitted that the emergence of animal-free technologies to make products like mayo are threatening the future of the egg industry. Even meat-departments at many grocery stores are offering plant-based meat items.

Now this might not seem like a big deal to you, but this is happening all around the food sector and is pretty huge when you consider the impact this could have as the trend continues. It's really a snowball effect. Every single person that goes vegan just increases the demand for vegan products, making companies want to put out more vegan products, which in turn makes it easier for people to go vegan. 

>You work with people to come up with solutions that are slow and sustainable. Meatless Mondays to start, then maybe you do one week out of a month.

Yes, this is a good way to start if you think you cannot go vegan overnight.

>Also veganism is unnecessary - vegetarian is just as effective

How so? Veganism in general boycotts more factory farming and animal agriculture than lacto-ovo-vegetarianism, so I'm not really sure where you're getting this idea from.

>We're omnivores

Obviously we are omnivores, and that's a wonderful thing, because it means that we can choose to be vegan for the betterment of the planet and to decrease the suffering we are responsible for causing. If we were strictly carnivores then, absent some technological breakthroughs, it would probably not be possible for us to make this choice.

>It's just a fact of life 

Yes, but it doesn't *have* to be. That's the point. We don't have to perpetuate the current status quo. We are an incredible intelligent and innovative people, and can overcome limitations.

Bison were both an ecological and cultural keystone species, shaping the grassland landscape through grazing and sustaining the Indigenous peoples that lived on the land.** By the 1880's, the large herds that once roamed the Great Plains were driven to the brink of extinction by overhunting.

> On May 24, 2006, the bison were released into the largest parcel of the West Block, which totals approximately 181 square kilometres (70 square miles). This area was chosen due to its large size, natural water source and access for park visitors. By taking into account the most recent estimates of vegetation production, current grazing prescriptions and strategies, visitor safety and bison handling operations, Grasslands National Park today manages a population of 400-500 bison. This target allows the park to prudently manage its herd according to the lowest biomass production predictable for the area (i.e. the poorest environmental conditions), while ensuring long-term retention of genetic diversity. Bison were initially reintroduced to restore the historic 'grazing regime' of large herbivores in a portion of the West Block of the park. **Bison grazing, in combination with fire, creates a diverse mosaic of habitats, which can benefit many grassland species. Their habit of wallowing creates small bowl-like depressions of bare soil that fill with water during spring runoff or after heavy rains. These wallows can provide habitat for prairie plants that require moist soils and serve as a water reservoir for insects, which in turn feed other grassland species.**

471,Canadian experts say the impact of animal agriculture as a major climate culprit isn't getting attention at United Nations Climate Change Conference - TechBomb News,"I'm not denying that society exists -- *at all*. I'm just saying that we can't expect society to change if we as individuals don't change. 

For example, if we want the culture to change and go in a certain direction, there needs to be something causing it to go in that direction. Without this, there will be no change. The cause can take many forms, but often it is the result of many individuals initiating the change in their own lives. This helps to normalize whatever it is that they are doing, and makes it easier for it to catch on with others. If enough people start doing it, it becomes an aspect of culture.

In some cases policy or law helps drive cultural change, but this is typically after much push from the public, where the change has rooted.

Look for example at the fur industry. The sale of fur has recently been outlawed in the state of California. Would this have happened if culturally the people of California viewed fur in the same way they did 50 years ago when it was common and seen as a status symbol worthy of pursuing? No, of course not. There would be no push. There would be every incentive for the state to *not* ban the sale of fur, since the public was fine with wearing it. The politicians would not dare propose any legislation to ban it, or they would risk losing the votes of all of the people that were into fur. 

What happened was that there was a huge cultural shift that started with some people boycotting fur, and ended with more people boycotting fur to the point where real animal-based fur has fallen out of fashion in the culture. It's no longer the sought-after status-symbol it once was.

Sometimes we need to make personal changes in order to influence a larger change in the culture.",2,hik3dof,1635538779,

Correct, but that's what initiated the cultural shift that made the ban possible.

>*Organizations*, collections of people,

Collections made up of individual people, yes.

>worked very hard to push the larger society to change their views toward fur.

And the result of this push by groups of individuals was that other individuals stopped purchasing fur, which lowered the demand for fur, creating a cultural shift that eventually made it possible to pass legislation.

If everyone was still wearing fur, no legislation would have passed because if everyone is wearing fur they aren't going to elect someone who is anti-fur.",1,hikt0j8,1635549693,

So many doom and gloom predictions, so few solutions. The solutions begin with you. Grow a garden, can what you grow, stop buying anything from a truck, keep some bees, buy sustainable products only, adapt your garden to the actual climate you live in, and if you live in the cold build a greenhouse. The solutions come from us. Take the burden off the government, off everyone else, and look in the mirror. Change begins locally. In my neighborhood I created my own edible landscape, I added Egyptian vegetables (Egyptian spinach, Egyptian walking onions) that can withstand desert conditions, and I inspired many of my neighbors to do the same. I started rescuing bees myself, and I keep my own beehive. My property is chemical free. Do something instead of complaining. 
And please stop buying bottled water. No scientist has looked at the situation, but the Chacaltaya disappearance was not caused by temperature changes but by lack of humidity. Why would humidity be changing?

572,An ‘emerging crisis’: The climate is changing too fast for plants and animals to adapt | New UN report highlights how warming temperatures are upending nature's life cycles — with devastating impacts on agriculture and biodiversity.,"Does climate modelling take into account that many people would die before worst case scenario happens? And that this itself could stop worst case scenario from happening?

For example, if most of India were to desertify, then surely the 1.4B people are not all going to manage to immigrate, right? Say about 50M rich people immigrate, another 50M manage to survive in whatever livable places remain(say in himalayas), and the rest 1.3B die, then surely that decreases total carbon emissions by a lot. Consider wet bulb temperatures killing lots of people in countries who emit a lot of carbon per capita. Surely that reduces total emissions, right?

If you are socially/economically high enough to do something significant about climate change, then surely you can also manage to not die of usual climate change issues, until most of the 8B die, and then carbon emissions are low enough to allow temperatures to drop again or not rise. So you don't need to do anything, am I right?

OTOH, plebs like me should continue living our 2-3Tons/year lives, because even me dying isn't going to make much difference, and I anyway won't be among the few millions who manage to avoid the worst consequences.",1,hxjwug9,1645255309,

> Perhaps most strikingly, it warns that life-cycle changes driven by warming temperatures and extreme weather patterns are affecting the natural rhythms of species around the world, often too quickly for them to adapt.

> The science of how living things time their birth, growth, reproduction and other life-cycle stages is known as phenology, and changes in these patterns - driven by environmental forces like temperature, the arrival of rains and other cues - are called &quot;Phenological shifts.&quot; Particularly in temperate regions of the world, where changing seasons let animals know to hibernate, flowers to bloom, birds to lay their eggs, and fish to spawn, warming temperatures and extreme weather driven by climate change can alter these natural cycles.

> Studies in the early 2000s found that &quot;The life stages of 203 plant and animal species had advanced by an average of about 2.8 days earlier per decade,&quot; according to the report.

Here's what needs to happen:

* Decarbonize electric generation by switching to a mix of wind, solar, storage, and nuclear
* End deforestation
* Electrify every technical process and thing we can
* Stop doing the things we can't

Making those happen means pusing your government to do it.  In countries where elections decide who holds power, getting involved in the political process is an excellent first step.

For people in first-world countries, changing how you get to work or heat your home is likely to make a bigger difference.  Switching to a bike or mass transit is ideal, and electrified car a second option.  Converting your home heating to use a heat pump instead of burning gas or oil is also a big one.  


In practice though, what's needed is not for a few people to make voluntary changes, but to change the rules of society so that everybody changes.  That means getting involved in the political process.  


You'd ideally do this [with a group](https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/b49xgi/how_to_get_involved_with_a_local_group_to_create/), but if you're in a country where power is decided by getting the most votes, you should look at:

Sustainable energy is important but so many people get tunnel vision. We need to use current tech available to us to wean off fossil fuels.

Personally I feel we need to build modern reactors so we can continue to develop renewables while being able to close down fossil fuel energy generation. Too often politics and zealotry get in the way, like how in Germany the Green Party got a nuclear reactor closed down ahead of schedule.

 >Human evolution is the evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family, which includes the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language, as well as interbreeding with other hominins, which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a web. The study of human evolution involves several scientific disciplines, including physical anthropology, evolutionary anthropology, primatology, archaeology, paleontology, neurobiology, ethology, linguistics, evolutionary psychology, embryology and genetics.

 [First calculations of greenhouse effect, 1896](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_climate_change_science#First_calculations_of_greenhouse_effect,_1896) 
 
 >By the late 1890s, Samuel Pierpoint Langley along with Frank W. Very had attempted to determine the surface temperature of the Moon by measuring infrared radiation leaving the Moon and reaching the Earth. The angle of the Moon in the sky when a scientist took a measurement determined how much CO2 and water vapor the Moon's radiation had to pass through to reach the Earth's surface, resulting in weaker measurements when the Moon was low in the sky. This result was unsurprising given that scientists had known about infrared radiation absorption for decades.

The long inefficient process of feeding animals plants to get them to a point of slaughter is completely unneeded when we can just eat plants.

So there's something you can do RIGHT NOW to completely minimize your environmental impact - eat plant based.

OR you can do what you are describing, and what, wait for local meat and plant production to happen, which is impossible because not everyone lives in 365 days a year fertile lands. But let's say you do live in Southern California or something, and buy local veggies and meat, THEN begin making what you think is an environmental impact, except you aren't, because it still involves meat production, which that study I linked above dives into.

The main factor is that we have too many humans on the planet.

Animal agriculture done properly is a vital and irreplaceable part of agriculture. Ruminants are needed in fields in rotation to fertilise the land, spread seed, remove weeds eg brambles and open soil for new plants to grow. Most livestock can live in wild places too, making use of forests and other marginal land that cannot be used for crop growing.

Done properly, animals require pretty much 0 feed grown for them and fulfil many tasks that a farmer would otherwise have to do.  

So buy properly reared meat, not the crap at the supermarket. Support farmers doing the right thing, because the alternative is bleak.

What is also harm is intensive nut and fruit growing eg avocados and almonds for milk, salad crops, which is depleting the most vital resource on the planet, which is fresh water. 

Add in monoculture crop planting and fossil fuel derived phosphate fertilisers, which run off into rivers, and it's a disaster for the whole ecosystem.

Had it 25 million people instead of ~250 million, would emissions be lower? Then overpopulation is a problem, and it should be recognised as such.

Equally, with farming, which is what I was trying to make the link to, the growing population has been behind the drive behind many of the innovations in industrial agriculture, in turn making food cheaper and more available and thus encouraging population growth again.

If every single person changed their consumption habits right now, the world would be better off.... That being said, we still can't even convince everyone that global warming is even happening. How can you possibly expect every person in the world to up and change consumption habits right now, when people don't even agree that the problem exists. 

Sure a cultural shift is necessary, but we don't have time for that. For example take a look at racism in the U.S. Racism still exists today, despite the large cultural shift in over the last several decades since the civil rights movements. Now think about the timeframe in which climate change must be dealt with. We don't have a century or even 5 decades before we run into major problems, it's already happening and people don't even believe it.

Cultural shifts take generations, and we simply don't have the kind of time to rely on cultural shifts alone. At some point, global leadership has to actively lead us away from the impending catastrophe by implementing climate centric policies and platforms.

The outside, the grasslands, they're already mostly overgrazed and heavily managed (similar to crops). They produce more methane (ruminants) and pollution from their feces and urine, and it requires displacement of local fauna and destruction of flora. All for a joke, because the ""productivity"" is going to be very low; essentially, the products made from their bodies will be scarce. Why even bother with this charade?

Technological innovation is gradually reducing the amount of people needed in production at almost every level of society. Within 20 to 30 years, it will probably be far cheaper to automate most jobs than hire a human worker, even ones considered to be safe middle-earning jobs at the moment. If we're not careful, we'll end up with a situation where the vast majority of production is owned by a very small amount of people who hoard all the wealth. 

If most middle and lower income people end up unemployed and with barely any money, such that they can't afford even basic provisions, we could end up with an economy that is suited almost entirely to providing luxury goods to a very small group of people. Or the entire thing could collapse.

The idea is that, when calculating emissions from animal agriculture, the FAO reports and other very low numbers do not take into consideration how much sequestration would occur were those deforested areas for growing feed and animals were reforested. That is, the carbon storage opportunity costs of that land is not taken into consideration. That is why they ended up on such a large number, and I gotta say, I understand this way more now.

To break it down differently, the space that is currently growing crops for animals and animals themselves would sequester greenhouse gases if it was re-forested. So since it's currently _de_forested, it's not doing that. So you need to include all the emissions that we're _not_ offsetting because 50% of the livable land on the planet is dedicated to raising animals for food.",1,h8gchpe,1628627677,

1124,Climate change: how bad is animal agriculture?,"In terms of just emissions, animal agriculture accounts for something like 10% ([according to the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions)). There are some reasons to suggest that this is a lowball number and that the real percentage can be as high as around 18% of emissions. However, whether or not that factors in the potency of emissions is not immediately clear. Animal agriculture produces more potent green house gases such as Methane and Nitrous Oxide. This is on top the fact that animal agriculture drives deforestation due to its land use for grazing and its inefficiency of use of calories. And according to [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production) meat production has tripled over the past 50 years. Although the population growth rate has gone down over the year, it is still positive and meat eating *can* very likely grow into something like the standard American diet all over the world as lower-income countries become more industrialized. Meaning more emissions and more deforestation.

[Livestock uses up 40% of the world's arable land.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211912416300013) All of that land can be used to plant trees as opposed to grazing lands and crops to feed livestock. Things like overgrazing and monoculture crops used to feed cattle cause poor soil quality and causes soil erosion which prevents effective carbon capturing in plants as well as releasing the carbon from the soil.

So animal agriculture is pretty bad.",2,h8nyb1g,1628782167,

(This has been criticized as an underestimate for not counting emissions from respiration, using a GWP for methane that's too low/for a longer and less relevant timeframe, and not considering the lost potential for carbon sequestration on land used for agriculture.) Other estimates has [put the figure as high as 51%](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet).

In terms of land use, [77% of agricultural land is used for agriculture](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#half-of-the-world-s-habitable-land-is-used-for-agriculture), which only provides 18% of global calories consumed and 37% of protein.

Very likely in other areas as well.

I sometimes wonder about the simplicity of that thinking, but I keep seeing it corroborated in too many places.

So, I wonder if they'll just make the money, and the gains in power, for as long as they possibly can.  Lawrence Lessig tells us that, basically, 400 families decide who can be elected by contributing campaign donations only to those who won't act against them.  One would think there would be some major dissent among the rulers, that some of them would be using their immense power and wealth to change the system to a sustainable one.  So, again, I have to wonder at what I just don't understand.

Scientists tell us capitalism has to go, that the Earth just can't sustain the growth that it requires, and can't sustain the continued exploitation of the environment needed to continue to support ""developed"" societies.  Maybe there's no way to do what we need to do without incredible societal upheavals.  And, scientists tell us, those are coming anyway.

1214,Animal agriculture is the #1 cause of climate change. Choose vegan.,"A lot of people here are sharing figures (many of them official) that underplay the role of animal agriculture. **I'm not saying these figures are wrong**, but whenever someone gives a percentage of greenhouse gas emissions attributed to any sector (including animal agriculture), they're relying on a bunch of (often unstated) assumptions. Of course, that's no different to the woman with the sign, but it's difficult to state assumptions on a protest sign. So we start with the [official figure](http://ageis.climatechange.gov.au/) of about 14% of emissions attributable to Agriculture and work from there.

* One of the biggest issues with measuring the climate change impact of animal ag in Australia is that the official figures separate out agriculture and LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change, And Forestry). Sometimes they are combined together into Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, but one of those (the one in the middle) is a massive carbon sink, so by combining them together, we use a massive offset of one, to draw down the massive carbon cost of the first. When you look at only animal agriculture, and include the figures of land clearing from animal ag, the figure, for animal agriculture is about 30% of total emissions.
* The next issue is how we measure the impact of methane. Methane is far more potent than CO2, but it breaks down in the atmosphere much faster. So there's no way of measuring like with like, so what we have to do is convert it to a figure for the amount of warming that it will be responsible for in a given timeframe (this is known as Global Warming Potential, GWP). Most official figures use a GWP of 100 (which we call GWP100, imaginative). Australia uses a GWP100 of methane of 25. That is, over a 100 year period, a tonne of methane will cause 25x the warming of a tonne of CO2. When people give CO2-e emissions, this is how they're getting it.   
This figure of 25 was taken from the IPCC 4th assessment report. You might be thinking ""Hey, wasn't there a 5th IPCC assessment report?"" The answer to that is yes. The fifth IPCC assessment report (IPCCv5), which has more up to date science, report gives a GWP100 of 28. So already, methane emissions in Australia are underestimated by 12%. But it doesn't stop there. The IPCCv5 also gives a figure that includes climate feedbacks, i.e. warming that happens earlier, will cause other warming to happen later on. These feedbacks are incredibly difficult to calculate, so they are only really (very well) educated guesses, but when taking these feedbacks into account IPCCv5 gives a GWP100 for methane of 34. So if we take this figure to be reasonably accurate, it means that *official Australian government* figures for methane are underestimated by 36%.

The above two points should be completely uncontroversial. If we use government numbers and properly attribute them to animal ag and use an up to date figure for GWP100, we can see that the actual impact of animal ag is much higher than the official figures would initially suggest. But there's another point that's also very important:

* In point 2, I was using GWP100 as if it's a given, which is what the government figures do. But it isn't a given. IPCCv5 says that: ""t*here is no scientific argument for selecting 100 years compared with other choices (Fuglestvedt et al., 2003; Shine, 2009). The choice of time horizon is a value judgement because it depends on the relative weight assigned to effects at different times.*"" Why do we use GWP100 then? Because that's what's conventionally done. So what if we instead choose to use another figure? IPCCv5 has our answer here, too. They give the GWP20 of methane, which is a whopping 84 (or 86 times with feedbacks). That means that every tonne of methane will, over the next 2 decades, be responsible for 86x the warming of each tonne of CO2. So if we decide to value the short term (20 years) over the long term (100 years) (and there is no scientific reason for valuing either over the other), the impact of methane in official government figures is underestimated by 244%.

So if we take those 3 points (and a few others that are also very important, but everyone's already stopped reading), the sign in the image suddenly becomes quite reasonable, though they perhaps should have added ""\*given a certain set of reasonable assumptions"".",7,fagk8ze,1576059581,

1238,Animal agriculture is the #1 cause of climate change. Choose vegan.,"Surely that depends on how much you eat meat and drive?

If you ate the recommended daily amount it would equal around 15 cows over a sixty year span.

I eat 10% of the daily amount so 230kg of emissions, I use 2 tanks of petrol and I'm at 288kg.

A cow does on average release between 70 and 120 kg of Methane per year. Methane is a greenhouse gas like carbon dioxide (CO2). But the negative effect on the climate of Methane is 23 times higher than the effect of CO2. Therefore the release of about 100 kg Methane per year for each cow is equivalent to about 2’300 kg CO2 per year.

Let’s compare this value of 2’300 kg CO2: The same amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) is generated by burning 1’000 liters of petrol. With a car using 8 litres of petrol per 100 km, you could drive 12’500 km per year (7’800 miles per year).

8 litres per 100 klm is better than I get as I have a work van, it's almost double that. 

7000k's is not a lot for work, the average for Australians is over twice that at 15000 

http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/australian-moterists-drive-average-15530km-201305090702




For every litre of petrol used in a motor vehicle, an average of 2.4 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2), is released into the atmosphere. When renewable fuels are combusted in your engine, they still emit greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, in quantities comparable to conventional fuels

Even at 15,000 k's @ 8 litres per 100 my emissions per year would surpass my beef intake if I ate the daily amount.

http://www.bp.com.au/ghg_veh_calculator/calculator.asp

remember also the calculation for the beef is the edible part, the inedible still needs to be replaced or accounted for, lumping all the emissions onto beef while we ignore the other half of the animal is deceptive imo

I'm not saying what you just said at all, though I appreciate the manipulation - I'm saying that cutting out red meat intake is the most effective **single action** most people can take to reduce their emissions. It's a fact. People can't simply decide to stop using their cars in total (they need to work, to take their children to school - and alternative transport isn't always an option) or to turn off all electric appliances in their house, and they can't force the government to immediately and totally transition to renewable energy sources.

Although lettuce is 3 times more polluting than bacon, per calorie.

You'll see that rice cultivation is 12% while burping for all ruminants is 16% plus the animal waste of all animals of 5% we can add the total but of course it will be less, but a total of 21%, 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#/media/File:Methane_Sources.jpg


•Cattle (raised for both beef and milk, as well as for inedible outputs like manure and draft power) are the animal species responsible for the most emissions in this sector, representing about 65% of the livestock sector’s emissions but we are talking the beef industry but I am happy to leave it at the higher total for this conversation.

http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/

Sooo that would mean 21% minus 35% would take them down to 13.65% 

What we have to add is biomass burning to the 12% : http://www.guidetothailand.com/thailand-weather/thailand-burning-season.php

But we are not sure how much this rice paddy stubble burning is part of that total but you will see here that it is quite high, along rice paddy's themselves so we could safely say 2% which would put rice above beef at 14% http://ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/004-147/tab1.gif

We also have to take into account that pollution output levels have increased and are going to continue from rice paddy's.


Overall, the rice paddy experiments revealed that increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere boosted rice yields by 24.5 percent and methane emissions by 42.2 percent, increasing the amount of methane emitted per kilo of rice.

It's going to be a 100% increase soon.

http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/plantsciences/features/recent_news/fall2012/rice_ag.htm

Increasing 14% by 42% puts rice at 19.88% which puts close to what these people say but as I said this is at 42% increase not the 100% increase due..


Some 20-30 percent of CH4 emissions result from anaerobic production in the paddy fields used in wet rice production

Yes, it is.

According to the Australian government, in 2018 the average Australian consumed 26kg of beef alone a year - for the sake of an example, I'm going to isolate the example to just beef. Lamb is worse than beef. In Oceania, throughout the production lifecycle each Kg of beef produces [~35kg of equivalent CO2 emissions](http://www.fao.org/3/i3461e/i3461e03.pdf) - this is conservative, I've seen studies estimate higher. This doesn't factor in acidification, desertification, water consumption requirements, or other environmental impacts of livestock, which are significant. 

This means that *alone* - and this doesn't include the demand for any of the other red meat products, like stock, veal, lamb, or the fact that not all beef produced is consumed, etc. - the average Australian demands 910kg of equivalent CO2 emissions per year, *just through their consumption of beef.* This also ignores the fact that a growing number of Australians don't eat beef at all already, so the average consumption among people who consume beef is actually higher than 26kg.

Lamb is even worse, and Australians consume a large quantity relative to the rest of the world - ~9kg  a year on average. One study estimates 40kg emissions per kilo of lamb, others estimate higher.

Factoring in average emissions from passenger vehicles, this means that isolating to strictly beef and lamb, and using conservative estimates that don't factor in the full impact, *the average* Australian person could cut out the equivalent of 7500km of driving per year just by changing their diets. Of course they'd have to replace it, but other foods are radically, enormously more efficient. Are you really going to argue that there's another single,  accessible action that most people can do to cut out nearly 7500km driving equivalent of energy consumption a year? 

>These same arguments can be made about eating less red meat - it's not always an option for people under certain medical advice, it's not always convenient when you have kids. Take the subjectivity out of it by looking at some actual stats on the footprint of particular actions.

If someone has medical advice saying they've got to consume beef and lamb, then I'm certainly not addressing them. Regardless, this is a poor argument. If red meat is a necessity, kangaroo is a very sustainable option. There's also chicken and pork that can be used with relative efficiency.

Bar medical reasons and early issues, like having to explore new recipes etc., it's relatively easy for people to transition to different forms of meat, or less meat (we're consuming more than the recommended intake on average already, after all). You could make the decision right now - but what family can snap their finger and go ""We're no longer going to drive 7500km this year - all that driving was just for fun!"" or ""We're turning off all the electrical appliances right now!"" or ""We're forcing the government to only supply us renewable energy!""?

>It's more like shifting goalposts. I think it's important to ""split hairs"" about the facts of emissions because there is so much misinformation that gets weaponised into encouraging inaction.

Dairy’s impact is over five times higher, and the impact of meat from ruminant animals  (e.g., beef) is over 23 times higher. In the USA, there  is considerable political opposition to addressing climate change, and strong cultural barriers to reducing meat consumption.

And how's that working out for you? I'm not trying to be glib, but people have been trying to provide simplistic messages to the public about climate change for years, and we've achieved fuck all in that time. I, personally, think it's important to tell the truth, even when that truth is not always palatable.

>World climate change is mostly driven by the burning of fossil fuels, as  this will have very long-term effects on the Earth's atmosphere, and  the sooner we stop burning them the better. Agriculture has short-term  effects.

This is true, which is why you'll never hear me say things like ""fossil fuels aren't the problem, animal agriculture is the problem"". There is a small minority of vegans who will say things like that, and I fundamentally disagree with them. 

But the flipside of that is that you can't ignore the short-term effects. And lets be clear, in the short term (e.g. over 20 years, which is how climate scientists measure the short term), animal agriculture will have a larger climate effect than fossil fuels. Over the long term (100 years) fossil fuels will have a big climate effect. And, to be clear, the choice to focus on the long term is not based in science. The IPCC fifth assessment report said that ""t*here is no scientific argument for  selecting 100 years compared with other choices (Fuglestvedt et al.,  2003; Shine, 2009). The choice of time horizon is a value judgement  because it depends on the relative weight assigned to effects at  different times"".*

And here's the kicker, *we can't ignore short term effects.* Yes, we shouldn't put everything in the short term basket, we need to eliminate our reliance on fossil fuels to prevent catastrophic climate change in the long term, but the next 20 years will determine what kind of dystopia we're heading for. If we don't significantly reduce our rate of warming over the next 20 years, we will almost certainly hit climate tipping points ([if we haven't already](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/27/climate-emergency-world-may-have-crossed-tipping-points)), after which point, the earth will warm catastrophically whatever we do. Focusing on one issue, and not the other is essentially locking in that scenario, and that's not something I'm willing to do for political expedience.

>Land clearing does have large effects on drought and the local climate  even in the absence of the changes it makes to greenhouse gases. These  effects can be resolved quickly if it is possible to revegetate cleared  areas.

That time is running out, and we're still clearing an insane amount of land for pasture. There's some light here, Queensland's land clearing laws have come into effect which should significantly reduce the rate of clearing there, but we're still clearing more land than we're revegetating in this country, and revegetation efforts take too long a time to have the kinds of effects we need them to have in the short term, and we will need to revegitate on a scale that has never before been attempted.

>I feel that to divert attention away from these essential truths simply  plays into the hands of the fossil fuel industries, who are still keen  to push the message that climate change may have many causes. 

If we want to argue strategy, I'm all for that. But the *essential* truth is that we need to address both fossil fuel use and animal agriculture to mitigate the catastrophic effects on climate change. Climate change *does* have many causes.

Sure.

As discussed in above comment, 910kg C02-e from beef per year, 360kg of CO2-e from Lamb based on [39.3kg CO2-e](http://static.ewg.org/reports/2011/meateaters/pdf/methodology_ewg_meat_eaters_guide_to_health_and_climate_2011.pdf). I couldn't find a more localised study for Lamb CO2 emissions.

= 1270kg CO2-e based on average meat + lamb consumption

I arrived at 1400 by factoring in the fact that 11.2% of Australians are vegetarian or vegan (http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/vegetarianisms-slow-but-steady-rise-in-australia-201608151105), so average consumption is not spread evenly. 

[The average new passenger vehicle emits .18kg CO2e per km driven.](https://www.ntc.gov.au/sites/default/files/assets/files/Carbon%2520dioxide%2520emissions%2520intensity%2520for%2520new%2520Australian%2520light%2520vehicles%25202018.pdf)

1400kg of CO2e emissions from average beef + lamb consumption for those who consume meat / 0.18kg = ~7600km equivalent driving

>I bet I could if you could provide some internationally accepted benchmarks like co2-e instead of analogous figures for which you've cited no data to support it.

You can make those claims, but we're both reasonable people clearly able to realise it's a lot more realistic to pick up chicken not beef in a supermarket than it is to re-adjust your entire weekly timetable, move within riding distance to work and school, potentially change your schools so that there's a safe bike path on the way, and a million other considerations. And I'm not even handwaving away those solutions - hell, if you believe that it's just as easy for most people to completely overhaul their modes of transport as it is to swap the protein they consume with dinner for kangaroo or chicken, then ah, great! I guess you should start recommending that to people too, the more individual action the better.

>I get the argument that not emitting from transport or household appliances requires user expense, while to not eat red meat... You just don't eat red meat. That's eminently sensible logic.

Firstly, I said most, not everyone. I'm assuming there's a good amount of people that aren't in the same position.

It's all out there, I'm not your Google. If you're concerned or interested in climate science you should be well aware of it already.

If you're interested in land damage, there's an enormous report from the IPCC here: https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl-report-download-page/

If you're interested in more general consumption, here's one of many:

https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/field/field_document/20141203LivestockClimateChangeForgottenSectorBaileyFroggattWellesleyFinal.pdf

Some summary findings:

- Recent analyses have shown that it is unlikely global temperature rises can be kept below two 
degrees Celsius without a shift in global meat and dairy consumption.

- Consumers with a higher level of awareness were more likely to indicate willingness to reduce 
their meat and dairy consumption for climate objectives. Closing the awareness gap is therefore

>As discussed in above comment, 910kg C02-e from beef per year, 360kg of CO2-e from Lamb based on 39.3kg CO2-e. I couldn't find a more localised study for Lamb CO2 emissions.

I think you might have actually been too conservative here - the figure from the paper (I found it once you told me what to search, it's hard to read but let's go with 35/kg) is carcass weight. So there would presumably be more total emissions associated with consumption per capita, which we'd need a factor to estimate the waste portion. But that's getting into the weeds.

>The average new passenger vehicle emits .18kg CO2e per km driven.

I don't think that's a fair assumption. New vehicles are more efficient, what you need to know is the fleet average. Otherwise it would be like comparing the lowest intensity grazing to driving a really old fuel-guzzling car. It is hard to find a fleet average estimate though.

The other point I want to make here is that you are comparing only the direct emissions from driving to a full life cycle of beef emissions, which is obviously going to be higher because they make assumptions about deforestation linked to beef production. So you aren't comparing like for like - you need a life cycle figure for transport to do a fair comparison.

But let's just quickly take electricity and compare it to beef, because that's a bit simpler. The AEMC's 2018 residential price trends methodology report gives estimates of typical household consumption for 2 person households on page 2. (I can't link on phone sorry). If averaged for NEM states, that gives an average annual consumption of 5675.8kwh. Now, since the NEM average is 0.732 in tonnes co2-e/mwh, that gives an average of 4.1 tonnes per household per year. That's substantially more, even halved to per person, than the life cycle figure for beef you've put out above. And someone could easily offset most of those emissions (once the life cycle of PV is taken into account) by installing solar and batteries.

Is it more costly than just not eating meat? Undoubtedly. But it might have more direct impact, based on public information.

I don't have time to write more on this topic. People have to do whatever they can to reduce emissions. I myself have shrunk near consumption by about 80% in the past 4 years. But if I can switch my whole house onto PV and get an electric car it will have a much bigger impact even than that.",2,faiicd8,1576108533,

You'll see vegetables have far more impact energy wise, far more pollution from nutrient run off, the land should be a moot point because it's non arable and greater potential for GHG and acidification.

This is confusing

>The source of GHGs in grass-fed and grain-fed systems further supports this explanation. Indeed, 30% and 52% of GHGs in grain-fed systems result from feed production and enteric fermentation, respectively. In contrast, feed production and enteric are responsible for 20% and 61% of GHGs, respectively, in grass-fed systems.

Although plans are in the making

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-15/seaweed-for-cows-could-be-mass-farmed-reduce-methane/11414724

I'm not sure we really should compare a calorie to a calorie and say they are they same either?

>Grass-fed beef may have environmental and human health benefits we could not analyze with our data. For example, grass-fed systems promote soil carbon sequestration (Derner and Schuman 2007) and within-pasture nutrient cycling while simultaneously decreasing eutrophication (Smith et al 2013). Additionally, grass-fed beef has higher micronutrient concentrations and a fatty acid profile that might lead to improved human health outcomes relative to consumption of grain-fed beef.
Furthermore, grass-fed beef may promote food security in cropland-scarce regions because it can be grown on land not suitable for crop production.

This was interesting

>Our analysis of five paired greenhouse–open-field systems shows that greenhouse production systems tend to emit almost three times more GHGs (figure 5; p = .089) because of the energy required to maintain greenhouses at ideal growing conditions.

I don't understand this one as we do this now, the heads of corn go one place and the stalks get fed to cows, sugarbeets, barley, all crops and excesses are fed to animals, maybe they just mean wastes after production, all that produce is going to rot on the ground creating methane, why is it that it's fed to cattle, they get blamed for it.

>In addition, using agricultural wastes and byproducts as animal feeds could reduce the environmental impacts of livestock production by 20% without reducing food quality or farmer profits

Choose vegan.,"Good call on the average car statistic - I figured there'd be some families driving much more than average and in much more inefficient cars, so certainly for these people even a complete removal of red meat wouldn't match a total driving overhaul (again though, people don't drive for fun, they drive for work purposes, or school - it's not a decision in the same way that red meat is, for some people drastically reducing transport emissions would require a total lifestyle overhaul - work, seeing family, school location etc.)

Also keep in mind that the average household size is 2.53 persons. So that 4.1 tons co2e comes to roughly 1.6 tons per person - a figure that seriously puts the above red meat stats into perspective. Remember, I did hedge my original comment by saying there were likely other things (full transport overhaul, not using any appliances or totally shifting to renewables) that might exceed red meat, so it's not as if I was being disingenuous.

In the end, do you think it's fair to say that my original comment was pretty fair, even if I didn't source it straight away? Perhaps if I qualify it a little more carefully, e.g.: for most people consuming average or more quantities of meat, one of, if not the single, biggest things they can do to reduce their carbon footprint without significant expenditure (batteries, solar) or lifestyle overhaul is to transition away from red meat (even to chicken or pork)?

I lived next to a multi-award winning pig farm in Wales, those pigs never ever saw the light of day, they lived in concrete cells.

But do you know what, they were LOCAL TO ME, so must be ok, yeah?

I was surrounded by sheep fields, they had the absolute best life because we were sat on the side of a mountain, so they got to roam free too.

But I would find lambs dead from cold weather snaps, not being able to survive a couple of extremely cold nights, they slowly died, alone and that would have been their existecnce.

To top it off, the other side of the road had a handful of cows, never more than 15-20 in huge fields, plenty of room to roam in and be free.

But every single year their calfs were taken from them, give or take a few weeks every single year and they would cry and moo as loud as they could for approximately 3-4 days straight, without stopping.

These are just my experiences, from a small welsh farming area (family farms, high welfare, local) and they were just all bad.

Me, my brother, sister, father, uncles, aunts and cousins all work full time on the same farm raising cattle. We all hold College degrees ranging from bachelors degree in Animal Science, masters degree in food science. And others similar majors and minors in-between. My point, we are not just po dunk back woods tabacoo chewing fools. We are well educated men and woman ,who are in my opinion, good people who work hard. Now that you know about me, here is my two cents. 

Farming cattle is not Bad for the environment. There are so many laws the forbid bad environment practices. When properly managed, cattle HELP land become more fertile because of the manure they leave on it, and if the cattle are raised in a barn, that manure still makes it out to the fields when the farmers haul it. Here is a great video if you are interested. https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI 

Second, as far a health goes, if you don’t want to eat meat because of your health, go for it. I am a libertarian and believe you can do whatever you like. Where I get annoyed is there is a LOT of misinformation spread about farming. And it really hurts our industry. We look bad in the public eye, and it hurts prices of meat, which in turn hurts a lot of good people in this industry. So please don’t spread information that you yourself can’t prove as true. Plenty of people eat meat every day of their life and live long healthy happy lives, diets work differently for different people. 

Let’s now touch on your accusations of animal cruelty. People who raise cattle get most of their money from those cattle being sold. In order for someone to want to buy those cattle, they need to be healthy. This includes proper feeding, clean water, good housing, and treatment of sick animals. I bet you almost every person who has grown up on a farm, grew up with this code drilled into their mind “My animals eat and drink before me”. I never went home to supper and called it a night unless every animal we own, which is around 3,500 cattle, was properly checked and taken care of. Is that considered animal cruelty? 

Lastly, 50 years ago, people raised animals and sold them same as now. That was only like 1970. People have been doing what we do since Roman times and before. Farmers raise animals and sell them for food. That is the whole idea. It was the first Job a human ever took. Settling down to farm. And it will be the last job to ever exist because the simple fact of the matter is, the world needs food.",1,itjm6ai,1666580664,

Wut? How does factory farming relate to slavery? Animals can't be slaves.

The human is the problem, and how we run the animals.

1) Cow in barn.

2) Corn and soy and hay in fields, largely monoculture.

3) Sow, fertilize, grow and cut this with machines. Carbon.

4) Package, store, transport and ship this with machines. Carbon.

5) Feed to animals an unnatural diet which makes them fart a lot. Methane.

6) Store and their manure up in giant piles where it decomposes anaerobically. Methane.

This is stupid. It's stupid. It's stupid. We're stupid. The cow is fine, the human is stupid.

Contrarily... 

[Silvopasture](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/food/silvopasture) cattle are a net carbon sink. So much so that it is ranked as the [NINTH](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank) best thing we can do to solve climate change.

The problem isn't the cow. Please spread the message. The cow is a carbon sequestering machine. It's the linch pin species in the most regenerative ecosystem on the planet. It is a fertility building carbon sink when it is allowed to be a cow.

Cows in forests, simulated predatory migration (by FAST rotation), allowing grasses to go vegetative and not be overgrazed. Manure is not piled up, it is spread out, where it decomposes into CO2 and not methane. Cows fart less because they eat grass not corn fattened. The feed they eat is ""produced"" 1 inch from their mouth, not 80 miles away in a monoculture and packaged and shipped.

Be very clear that even if we had the option to not eat any cows, or to eat silvopasture run cows, then from a carbon sequestering, soil building, fertility building perspective, we are BETTER eating cows run inside silvopasture than not eating cows at all.

All these studies look at feedlot cattle, which is terrible destructive almost evil stuff. But we draw the WRONG conclusion from them, which is to not eat meat. We should be eating less meat, sure, but what we really need to do is transition pasture into forest, then run cattle through swales laneway'd forest, quick rotation, grass and weed fed cattle, build site fertility, and the cow exists inside an ecosystem and gets to be a cow all day every day of it's life.

We can give up meat for ethical reasons, but the reality is that the entire world won't go vegan.

It should be a discussion that politicians open up with the public. Maybe there aren’t a lot of truly Vegan politicians.

The value of gemstones and the value of meat come from different reasons. Gemstones have historically been and still are prized for their rarity and painstaking extraction. So synthetic ones lose much of their value. 

On the other hand, people typically value meat simply because the meat itself tastes good. If lab grown meat can replicate the taste of meat from animals sufficiently well, I doubt they'd be too concerned about the source.

important part:

Specifically, plant-based diets reduce  food’s emissions by up to 73% depending where you live. This reduction  is not just in greenhouse gas emissions, but also acidifying and  eutrophying emissions which degrade terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  Freshwater withdrawals also fall by a quarter. Perhaps most  staggeringly, we would require \~3.1 billion hectares (76%) less  farmland.

""Our hunter-gatherer future: Climate change, agriculture and uncivilization-


•The stable climate of the Holocene made agriculture and civilization possible. The unstable Pleistocene climate made it impossible before then.


•Human societies after agriculture were characterized by overshoot and collapse. Climate change frequently drove these collapses.


•Business-as-usual estimates indicate that the climate will warm by 3°C-4 °C by 2100 and by as much as 8°–10 °C after that.


•Future climate change will return planet Earth to the unstable climatic conditions of the Pleistocene and agriculture will be impossible.


•Human society will once again be characterized by hunting and gathering.


For most of human history, about 300,000 years, we lived as hunter gatherers in sustainable, egalitarian communities of a few dozen people. Human life on Earth, and our place within the planet’s biophysical systems, changed dramatically with the Holocene, a geological epoch that began about 12,000 years ago. An unprecedented combination of climate stability and warm temperatures made possible a greater dependence on wild grains in several parts of the world. Over the next several thousand years, this dependence led to agriculture and large-scale state societies. These societies show a common pattern of expansion and collapse. Industrial civilization began a few hundred years ago when fossil fuel propelled the human economy to a new level of size and complexity. This change brought many benefits, but it also gave us the existential crisis of global climate change. Climate models indicate that the Earth could warm by 3°C-4 °C by the year 2100 and eventually by as much as 8 °C or more. This would return the planet to the unstable climate conditions of the Pleistocene when agriculture was impossible. Policies could be enacted to make the transition away from industrial civilization less devastating and improve the prospects of our hunter-gatherer descendants. These include aggressive policies to reduce the long-run extremes of climate change, aggressive population reduction policies, rewilding, and protecting the world’s remaining indigenous cultures.""

We have extracted every vital natural resource which have taken hundreds of millions to billions of years to accumulate, that does not require extremely advanced technology and complicated global supply chains. Our sun is very gradually increasing in luminosity and subsequently increases global temperature and lowers biological productivity on the earth. In 1 billion years the oceans will begin to boil off, and the incredibly delicate conditions for complex life will cease to exist on our planet. In the four billion years following this event our sun will grow large enough to engulf all the inner rocky planets, and eventually eject most of its outer mass in a violent explosion transforming into a white dwarf. This solar system as we know it will never foster life again, it will be cold, dark, devoid of life, and very uneventful. By an incredible chance any intelligent species capable of interstellar travel stumbles across our solar system, there would not be a single trace of evidence humanity ever existed.

It took decades of strict 1 male deer per hunter(no females allowed to be killed) for the population to rebound. And deer are a very prolific species on a human landscape. They love agriculture and chainsaws. This was at a time when the human population was dwarfed by the amount of people today. If the current population turned to wild game as a major source of calories, deer would be gone, turkeys would be gone, I'm not even sure how many rabbits and squirrels would make it through  a few months of hungry humans. Even today, you can drive around and see so many deer(too many according to farmers and insurance companies), but if you go hunting on the small tracts of land that allow public hunting, you hardly see any.

1772,Study Shows 51% Of All Climate Change Is From Animal Agriculture,"Just to be clear on this... the way we run animals right now is both damaging to the environment and cruel to the animal. However, we often make the incorrect conclusion from this that the animal is the problem. 

The human is the problem, and how we run the animals.

1) Cow in barn.

2) Corn and soy and hay in fields, largely monoculture.

3) Sow, fertilize, grow and cut this with machines. Carbon.

4) Package, store, transport and ship this with machines. Carbon.

5) Feed to animals an unnatural diet which makes them fart a lot. Methane.

6) Store and their manure up in giant piles where it decomposes anaerobically. Methane.

This is stupid. It's stupid. It's stupid. We're stupid. The cow is fine, the human is stupid.

Contrarily... 

[Silvopasture](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/food/silvopasture) cattle are a net carbon sink. So much so that it is ranked as the [NINTH](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank) best thing we can do to solve climate change.

The problem isn't the cow. Please spread the message. The cow is a carbon sequestering machine. It's the linch pin species in the most regenerative ecosystem on the planet. It is a fertility building carbon sink when it is allowed to be a cow.

Cows in forests, simulated predatory migration (by FAST rotation), allowing grasses to go vegetative and not be overgrazed. Manure is not piled up, it is spread out, where it decomposes into CO2 and not methane. Cows fart less because they eat grass not corn fattened. The feed they eat is ""produced"" 1 inch from their mouth, not 80 miles away in a monoculture and packaged and shipped.

Be very clear that even if we had the option to not eat any cows, or to eat silvopasture run cows, then from a carbon sequestering, soil building, fertility building perspective, we are BETTER eating cows run inside silvopasture than not eating cows at all.

All these studies look at feedlot cattle, which is terrible destructive almost evil stuff. But we draw the WRONG conclusion from them, which is to not eat meat. We should be eating less meat, sure, but what we really need to do is transition pasture into forest, then run cattle through swales laneway'd forest, quick rotation, grass and weed fed cattle, build site fertility, and the cow exists inside an ecosystem and gets to be a cow all day every day of it's life.",3,feh0wgr,1579106817,

Now tell your friends and family about it.

It will be a gradual process and as demand for meat goes down, animal agriculture industries will decrease the number of animals killed daily and regular farmers will have higher demand for all their vegetables.

I totally agree with you, I just don’t see why this gets more attention than regenerative agriculture.

Right now, almost every produce farm in the states does not sequester any carbon out of the atmosphere as they normally would through photosynthesis because artificial fertilizers literally kill the microbiomes the soil responsible for storing carbon that is transferred from plant roots into the ground. The carbon literally leeches from the ground and turns back into CO2 and soil tilling only accelerates the process. Converting just a small percentage of farms to utilize regenerative agricultural practices would have a profound impact on reducing CO2 levels without destabilizing the current system of food production. This is something we can easily do right now with almost no repercussions and the money spent on it would be made back within a couple of years through reduced water and resource consumption. 

As for animal agriculture, we need to start by feeding cows things they are meant to digest like grasses and roots to reduce methane output. People need to support this effort through not spending money on cheaper meats or fast food that finance factory animal farms, with will perpetuate the feeding of corn and grains causing high methane output for profit. Unfortunately, this is practically impossible from a cultural perspective given the fact that so many people rely on fast food and cheaper alternatives due to economical inequities and poverty, but that’s another issue. 

All of that considered, there’s tons of methane leeching out of the thawing permafrost in Siberia to deal with which is possibly a greater threat than the output of methane caused by animal agriculture. We have too many variables that make animal agriculture possible that cannot be changed without first changing things economically and culturally.

You can raise cattle on land that isn't cleared.

You can raise cattle on land with restricted water availability.

So how much forest needs to be cleared for the increase in land use to support solely plant-based diets?


Edit: response to the paper.

The paper raises that the issue of land type is not relevant as you would simply divert the input crops to humans, however negates to address the crop types that are often popular with humans on a vegetarian and/or vegan diet (e.g. rices over grains). You cannot simply grow rice where we grow grain.

The paper also does not consider the outcome where insects are instead used alongside other sources of protein to reduce dependancy on cattle whilst maintaining an omnivorous diet. Insects also address most of the negative aspects attributed to cattle in the article.

Edit 2:

Also, no one is addressing the important role for cattle by-products in science and medicine. E.g. bovine serum for cell culture and biological medicine.

It makes way more sense to have a multifaceted response addressing climate issues posed by all agriculture, than pushing for an unrealistic and potentially unecessary pipe dream. Consider:

1) great reductions to emissions can be made with sustainable farming practice

2) incentives to reduce land clearing, and to award agricultural land purposing to be suitable to the local climate (e.g. no cotton/nuts/rice in the Murray Darling)

3) supplement traditional protein sources with non traditional sources (e.g. insect, plant)

4) disincentives to fossil-fuel mediated agriculture (e.g. natural gas derived nitrogen fertilisers)

5) appreciation that with (4) in place, any emissions and inefficiencies imposed by cattle are always net carbon neutral- the emissions are derived from the growing of the original feeding crops.

6) incentives to use arid land for sustainable dry farming when available (e.g. cattle on arid land in Central Qld).",-6,hvcqnyi,1643848728,

Said he was happy to be proven wrong.,"The lecturer is correct as far as CO2 indexes in the country are concerned. National rice agriculture emissions produces about the same amount of CO2 when compared to national animal agriculture. The culprit for rice agriculture’s large emissions are from the incineration and combustion of dry rice husks. Although, overall rice agriculture emissions compared to overall animal agriculture emissions are speculated. The reason why this speculation is so is because global research is lacking to discover the total global animal agriculture’s production on carbon dioxide and methane, coupled with the total global amount of rice agriculture’s emissions. China and other Southeast Asia countries do not have substantial metering as far as their rice agriculture emissions are concerned.

But it is difficult to compare the two. CO2e per tonne of rice vs CO2e per tonne of carcass weight isn't really a sensible comparison as one is a source of protein and one a source of carbohydrates (rice is ~3% protein). CO2e/Ha isn't very helpful either. 


Intensive animal production is a major contributor to climate change, sure, however a few recent studies have shown that rangeland animal production in areas unsuitable for crop production is beneficial in terms of food production and has comparatively low CO2e emissions.


Edit: in short, it depends how you do the numbers, but certainly by many metrics rice production could come out worse than animal production.

>""If you change your diet, you reduce your personal greenhouse gas emissions by 30-50%"" - Oxford scientist Dr. Joseph Poore

With all due respect, Dr. Poore, are you sure about that?

When subsidies & bailouts detach the animal ag industry from the laws of supply and demand, how much can our dietary choices truly reduce animal production?

If our markets were truly free - Dr. Poole would be correct. Sadly, this isn't the system we're living in.

The reality is that subsidies and bailouts - to the tune of $50 billion a year in the US - keep animal farmers breeding more cows, chickens, and pigs, regardless of how many people give up meat on Mondays or go fully vegan for life.

Let's be clear - we must keep turning people vegan. We must reach that magic number where 3.5% of the people are vegan activists. At that point, society will change rapidly. Please - keep driving to those numbers! Don't relent!

In the meantime, the Vegan Justice League is here - fighting these bailouts and subsidies, so that our vegan activism can have its full effect.

This is an excellent paper on farming behavior

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096321000279

>There is anxiety among farmers about the weather and the climate especially when they perceive that nothing can be done if the weather would behave against their favor. One of the ways that comfort the farmers from this anxiety is the use of the Honorio Lopez Tagalog Calendar to refer to lucky days to plow, plant, and harvest, and the unlucky days to avoid:

>“Guide lamang. Maganda rin yung may sinusunod na gabay. Hindi naniniwala nang 100% pero para may konti kang masasandalan. Parang may nagpapayo sayo na ‘wag ka magtatanim sa masamang araw. Kinagisnan sa magulang na siya ay nagbabasa lagi ng gay-an.” (It is just a guide and it’s good that you follow a reference. I do not believe in it completely but at least you have something to lean on. It is like someone is giving you advice not to plant on unlucky days. My parents did the same thing.)",7,it0a49k,1666224805,

> How does livestock reverse damage caused by mono crops. Does that assume mono crops aren’t being used to feed the same livestock? What of water contamination and consumption and methane production?

I am talking about grassfed cows. Cows that are not fed any mono crops. There is plenty of evidence demonstrating that livestock can reverse desertification, sequester carbon, and restore soil quality. Many studies demonstrate this, and White Oak Pasture is an exemplary farm when it comes to regenerative agriculture.

When you speak of water contamination, you are still referring to factory farming. The matter of methane I do believe is exaggerated. 

I do believe that factory farming is bad for the environment. I do not believe that pastured farming is bad for the environment. I believe it is good.

There's a bit of an assumption built into your arguments right there.

Corn currently delivers the highest possible calories per acre, that is how we are currently able to support our meat demand. Given that natural grass lands are limited to only certain parts of the temperate world, you are essentially suggesting that only people who live near grass lands should consume meat.

So, yes intensive animal agriculture is much more efficient than extensive animal agriculture. Intensive animal agriculture not only reduces the GHG emissions associated with animal agriculture but also drastically reduces the land required for animal agriculture, as well as the deforestation caused by animal agriculture due to reducing the land needed, and also leads to a reduction in water and land degradation. 

Of the total 18% of animal agriculture's contribution to climate change, only 5% of that contribution is associated with intensive animal agriculture. The other 13% is from extensive animal agriculture. [http://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e03.pdf](http://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e03.pdf)

When you consider this it's really not that hard to see that by . moving furthering the intensification of animal agriculture we would drastically reduce the contribution it makes to climate change.

>although it would be a clear improvement for the 70 billion animals that suffer and that we kill each year

How would extensive production be ""a clear improvement"" for the animals? Receiving a lower quality diet, health care, housing, and management is somehow better for the animals?

>So yeah the only way for animal agriculture to contribute less to climate change and global depletion is by shrinking (and hopefully disappearing)

This is just wrong and I'm not even going to address it again. If you can't see how intensive agriculture would be a huge environmental improvement then that's not my problem. However the part of animal agriculture . ""hopefully disappearing"" I feel should get an explanation. Have you considered how we as a society would cope with the end of animal agriculture? Without a logical plan in place for what happens after animal agriculture would end, I don't get how that can even be a part of the discussion. What would happen to the billions of people relying on animal agriculture for food, income, jobs, etc? What about the billions of dollars animal agriculture contributes to the global economy? What about the billions of animals globally that would no longer have a purpose? What about the increased demand for plant-based diets leading to the increase in climate change caused by crop production?

No it wasn't, before farming it was mostly veggies, nuts and grains with small amounts of meat for energy. When there was a big kill, meat would be plentiful, but most would be dried and/or mixed with grains, fruits and more to store it and for ease of eating while moving. 

After farming it was mostly grains, meat was expensive and mostly for the rich.

Plenty of modern studies of ancient sites have shown this, old studies thought it was all meat because they found so many bones, but bones just don't break down as easily, so all the mounds and mounds of veggie and fruit waste all disappeared.

The majority eat way more meat than this diet recommends. What I am asking is if 99% of your diet is plants and the 1% is easy to replace, why not go the whole way?

During the famine of 1914-17 drought stalked the villages in India. Brahmist farmers were forced to grow sugarcane and indigo even as their bellies rang hollow and the skin stretched on bare bones from hunger.

Brahmanism, a caste badge of pride, meant that they couldn’t think of the plentiful cattle as food. In a religion without strict dictates, the only commonality is an adherence to the belief that a cow is a symbolic mother not to be harmed.

So, children fell to anemia, malnutrition, miasma and marasmus. Bones turned brittle, chests caved in, nursing breasts dried. 
Hunger

And yet edible wildlife went about unmolested.  The only meat eaters in the village were the Dom folk; untouchables and outcastes. They wove baskets, cleared excrement and made leather goods.

As the upper castes shrivelled and shrunk and fell in heaps of rags and bones, the Dom thrived. 

But times are changing. They must change. This year (2012), Dalits and Muslims led a protein riot in which around 1,500 Dalits were fed beef Biryani at the event in Hyderabad. It might have been provocative, but it sent a message: we will no longer submit to archaic taboos.

It is not clear when or why he adopted it, since some accounts of his dietary habits prior to the Second World War indicate that he consumed meat as late as 1937. By 1938, Hitler's public image as a vegetarian was already being fostered, and from 1942, he self-identified as a vegetarian. Personal accounts from people who knew Hitler and were familiar with his diet indicate that he did not consume meat as part of his diet during this period, as several contemporaneous witnesses—such as Albert Speer (in his memoirs, Inside the Third Reich)—noted that Hitler used vivid and gruesome descriptions of animal suffering and slaughter at the dinner table to try to dissuade his colleagues from eating meat.

In their mind they think change comes from some giant over arching government or larger than life figure like Malcolm X.

And that will not be changed with individual choices. They have a point. Far too many vegans put an emphasis on the environmental issues, for example. Individual consumption habits will not fix the climate crisis. It's an issue inherent to the economic and production system of capitalism. There's this slogan of ""no ethical consumption under capitalism"", which is true. Whatever you choose to buy is always a product of some sort of abuse and exploitation. And then there's the fact that they're primarily preoccupied with the exploitation of humans, which is also valid in my perspective.

That being said, even if animals and industry workers could be afforded better conditions, I still wouldn't eat them. That's why I don't eat hunted or fished animals anyway either.

So I think it's a mixture of them not wanting to make the change and considering animal rights less important than human rights (even tho it doesn't have to be one or the other) and vegans putting too much emphasis on the climate aspect when leftists have a better understanding and a more complex solution to that problem and understand we won't save the planet by ""voting with our dollars"".

However, as consumers we can choose to be conscious for our own ethical reasons without expecting to bring down the whole machine. Personally I avoid Amazon, Nestle and others because *I* don't want *my* hard earned cash going to companies and industries that exploit people, animals and the planet for a profit.

Indeed, boycotting *can* work when large numbers get on board. Boycotting was a powerful weapon in the international fight against Apartheid in SA, for example.

Similarly with veganism, we *are* effecting change. As more and more people pursue a vegan lifestyle, more and more products and services are becoming available. Veganism is more visible and increasing in influence. In the UK, for example, Flora margarine reformulated their *core product* to be vegan friendly. Many other companies are moving to offer vegan products. Yes, it's in response to an emerging market in which to make profit, but under capitalism hitting them in their profits is the only way to make them hurt.

I think a lot of problems in the world have the “I’m not gonna do it because individual change won’t make a difference” tag line behind them on any side of politics. You hear it when talking about voting, energy conservation, water conservation, trash cleanup, protests, etc. 

I don’t think the argument is inherently ill-intended, but it definitely comes from sheer ignorance. People don’t want to undergo an admittedly huge lifestyle change with the sole purpose of making an impact. Many don’t want to spend their weekend picking trash up off the beach knowing that megacorps are dumping millions of tons into the ocean every day. 

I think the way to inspire a change in this somewhat ignorant train of thought is pretty easy. People need to realize that - yes, you aren’t making any huge impact by changing your lifestyle! That’s not the point! Rather than having a savior complex where you’re the only one doing anything, know that you are now a powerful member of an entire culture of change around you. Sure, your single vote won’t mean jack shit in the next election, but millions of people voting alongside you will... participating in protest against the political machine that is the electoral college will definitely make a difference. Picking up trash tomorrow won’t make a crazy change in the environment if you were the only one doing it, but there are hundreds of thousands of people out there doing it as well, and millions of others protesting and petitioning against poor waste management day in and day out. 

As for veganism - sure mate, your individual diet and lifestyle change will certainly not matter towards massive animal-based conglomerates, but know that there are millions of others just like you. Every Vegan bodybuilder out there is proving wrong those who spread misinformation and disinformation against plant-based diets. Every vegan that directs documentaries exposing the pure evil behind dairy farms, grindhouses, and animal exhibits is causing unimaginable, inspiring tsunamis of attention for the cause. Shit that’s what got me dying to start it in the first place. 

The more people are introduced to veganism, the more mainstream attention it will get. Companies aren’t transitioning away from animal products and cruel-testing because it’s trendy, they’re doing it because it’s getting more and more expensive by the day. Shareholders that vote vegan are causing huge changes in big businesses and these companies are being forced into changing for the better. They know that crimes against four-legged friends are not going unnoticed anymore and that their every move is being watched closely.

Slaughter house workers wouldn't be needed, farm animal vets (they must have a real name) would be in less demand, meat packaging and processing workers would need money jobs.

That doesn't mean you should participate. 

Child labor is in a massive amount of the products we buy, avoiding those products won't stop chil labor from occuring. You have to make a systematic change. That being said if you can help it, you should avoid participating in these systems. 

If something is profitable and goes unpunished people will do it. Companies care about money, that's it. We want a change in the system, capitalism always facilitates violence towards those economically below us. In the long term we have to get rid of capitalism, in the short term we avoid the horrors we can. 

Veganism is one of the easier horrors to avoid. Companies often aren't transparent in labor sourcing/practices. This makes it incredibly difficult to figure out which item on the shelf had a worker paid fairly and not overworked vs abused and underpaid. There is no child labor/forced labor labelling on packaging. For animal products there is. You know if an animal has been exploited because the ingredients are smack dab on the back. 

You should avoid contributing to systems of violence as much as you can in everyday life.

 I would ask them if there was child labor labelling on packaging and options existed that did not include the use of child labor but we're fewer in variety and at times slightly more expensive though affordable to them would they buy the child labor product for the sake of convenience?",1,i8ihcmg,1652483544,

I do have a personal bias against the word environmentalism. It's a *political* movement aimed at changing people's behavior. By force if ""necessary."" On the other hand, ecology is about living systems interconnecting and interacting.

Environmentalism looks a lot like evangelical Christianity, with a self-selected elite dictating to others how those others should act based on a revealed knowledge. There are *way* too many similarities to ignore.

So, is this characteristic of any group that has an economic advantage over other groups in the same society? I'd argue not by itself, but that is probably how such a movement *starts*. It spreads by convincing people that they have access to a certain ""wisdom"" that those outside the group can't share. And of course, dissent against the True Way must be ruthlessly suppressed.

At this point, we move from similarities to damn near one-to-one correspondence.

Theory: *For The Greater Good* can't exist without an ""enlightened"" elite deciding that only they have the Higher Truth. It can't spread unless it exploits the economic disparity and validating people's helplessness in the face of forces they ""can't control."" It's appeal is not *solving* problems, but making sure that at least some of the unworthy elites *get theirs.*

Could *any* such movement start and spread in anything except abundance? It seems unlikely. From the first environmentalism emerged in a society with ""haves"" and ""have nots."" It's reliance on scientism and politics rather than science and solutions supports this theory.",1,ih7n6t1,1658509544,

If there is no science, there is no ""higher moral cause."" Which reduces environmentalism to one more political cause that can't convince people without force.

Given the worsening economy, environmentalism is losing it's appeal among those who are struggling to feed their families or put a roof over their heads. 

Which means that concern over climate change will drop too. ""Transitioning to a carbon free economy"" makes great headlines, but when it increases prices at the gas pump or makes heat in winter more expensive, people will want something else.

**Automated summary:**

> The animal agriculture industry is a major contributor to environmental crises, including greenhouse gas emissions and habitat loss.

>Changing our food system is one of the key solutions to the climate crisis, and this change can come in many forms: We need policies that support a more resilient, plant-centric global food system with concrete measures for supporting diet change.

>Over the course of 2022, HSI, together with Mercy for Animals Brazil, has fully implemented commitments from four Brazilian municipalities to transition 20% of all meals served in municipal schools to plant-based food.

>Experts from HSI will attend the conference and co-host three events at the Food4Climate Pavilion , led by ProVeg International.

To stop biodiversity loss we need to save land, and more land is used to raise livestock than for anything else. A vegan diet saves more land than any other type of diet.

Produce only takes up 3% less than pasteured lifestock with 23%. But shifting the point of view from the land use as a fact of argumentation to the question how we use the land makes all the difference.

For example, any vegetable crop that is grown in tilled ground, fed supplemental fertilizers and is then shipped across the world (not locally sold) has a way greater carbon footprint and distruction factor than the same mass of land inhabited by lifestock after consideration of its pollution factor. The one type of land use destroys the soil through agricultural practice and depletion the other cycles the nutrients effectively enhancing carbon sequestration. 

As it is true wild animals could do the same job, we have killed all the buffalos native to the usa where i live to starve a race of humans that are indigenous to this land and knew how to balance its use. Not having enough wild buffalo or mustang roaming the plains, we are bound to replace them with other hoofed grazing animals to be able to sequester more carbon into the soil. The trampling action of the herds is what does the sequestration. Also, yes methane production may be elevated in pasteured lifestock but its balanced out in the end. The healthy microbiome contents of ruminant animals further healp the soil biota and the overall ecosystem to thrive.

Which bring me to your last point eating upward the food chain. If you apply regenerarive agriculture there is no food chain. The metaphore of a food chain gets obsolete understanding that there is the nutrient cycle instead. The soil food web looks at how nature distributes nutrients and as such energy. Energy is never lost it just changes form. Industrial agriculture ignores this fact. You only have a food chain if the input for one needs to be added by supplementation of sort. Hence fertilizer, added lighting in green houses or added microorganisms, pestecides herbicides fungacides, create the food chain, creating many waste products down the road.

 When looking at the soil food web we can understand the circle nature creates where the waste of one organism becomes feeding ground/energy for another. Energy in nature is never wasted.

We humans create the waste, pollution and environmental imbalance by the ways we act. As much as capitalism has an upward trajectory so has a food chain, where energy is not recycled but yet accumulates continously to toxic levels, ultimately harming and poisoning humanity.

The discussion just isn't about lifestock vs plants, its about our approach of how to feed the world sustsinably. 

You wouldnt want an inuit to go vegan, would you? Natural habitat and local land tenance matters in your argumantation and isn't just black or white. 

Much like a salad there isn't just lettuce in a salad. You'll need some other green and veggies in your case proteins too, to make it nutritious. But you also need a balanced dressing to enhance fatty nutritional uptake herbs for health and maybe some seeds for mineral uptake. Your body could jot live without balanced nutrition, so why deprive nature of its nutritional balance when all we need is proper management to do so.

While there is lots of medical arguments for a vegan diet besides nature, it is just not doable for chronic pain patients especially the ones with autoimmune disease. I have rheumatoid arthritis and can not live on a vegan diet. I have tried after reading the china study but it caused more harm than health due to a lectin overload, causing immuno reactions.

Perspective in the discussion matters. There is just not a one single solution that can be applied to all the angles this subject needs to be discuseed under.

If everyone would use a composting toilet, a methane digester and a graywater system, how much emmissions, waterusage and pollutiin could we curb? But are you ready to give up your water closet/toilet for the environment?

It's about time: Help abolish animal agriculture once and for all.","If you want to point out the capitalistic abuse and profiting of indiginous agriculture knowledge thousands of years old, then yes, sure its just a marketing fad.

But if you are actually wanting to drive active scalable sustainability practices, you'd be rather interested in how the natural ecosystems work, which by the way includes animals and aren't exclusive of them. livestock or any other farm animal is treated with respects to life cycles, habitat and species specifics in regenerative agriculture.

I am not sure what the pondering on land use is all about., when regenerative agriculture is effectively building the soil, creating more land that will be there after farming has happened. Again its about cycling nutrients through natural means reestablishing microbiota for a 100% carbon sequestration, that includes no2 and co2 emissions. Stops soil erosion, fills the water table not deducts from it and turns aggregated dirt in to living soil. Farms are built along nature lines. Indiginous farmers used the landscape to their advantage, rather benefiting from the natural ecosystem than destroying and eliminating it to build industrial agriculture plots. All the indiginous knowledge of these concepts are gain through observation of natute and the land trying to mimic it. Regenerative agriculture actively practices land tenancy towards nature, with nature being the landlord so to say.

Its not about animal or plants, its about how we treat the soil to produce the nutrients we need. If we can apply solutions to that, the animal vs plant question is irrelevant because nature provides them both and asks us to be tenants to all of them. We just need to understand how our indiginous forefathers and mothers managed to feed their nations in balance with nature,  No matter if this knowledge has been abused by the markerung industry.

What is natural death? Dying because of old age, letting an animal suffer so they can die without human intervention, etc. Sometimes killing is still a part of the process esp when an animal needs to be put out of their misery. 

The age of the animal is important for human consumption. An elderly cattle might not have as viable meat as a younger cattle. A native/indigenous grazer such as the buffalo/bison is one industry that I will support, especially those under Indigenous business such as Tanka. Tanka has lots of buffalo/bison meat products. 

Grazing doesn't just mean cattle, it also adds goats, sheep, and some birds too like chickens and ducks.

How do we know that someone doesn't want to die esp when that someone is a cattle or a sheep or a chicken etc. We human can clearly state it, don't kill me, or I don't want to die, etc. For animals that we don't exactly have a translator and can only interpret meaning from their calls and body language, we can't 100% say that. I can look at a cattle all day and interpret what it's feeling or maybe even wants, but can it really communicate to me that it doesn't want to die? No, it can't. I respect the process of death when it happens or needs to happen and it is as swift and quick as it can be from what I have seen and participated in. I've held chickens and rabbits  before giving them a quick chop at their necks. It's messy, it's gory, it's not a fun process but I still learned how to respect that animal, how to clean it, pluck feathers, gutting it, butchering the meat. It was several years ago but I still hold that experience as one that I will never forget. 

Even if regenerative is used by companies as their environmental platform, its principles have being used for millennia in many places. From agroforestry, to silvopasture, to pastoralism, there is lots of variety that used animal agriculture. That article you included selects a class of wildlife versus cattle ranchers who are using the idea of regenerative ag to get access to land. Of course that is bad and I agreed that domesticated animal shouldn't mix with wildlife. Wild elk need to free range while the cattle shouldn't. Truly regenerative animal ag, uses principles like managed grazing were cattle and/or other animals like sheep, goats, chickens etc are fenced into locations and moved based on pasture growing patterns and seasonality. 

There is potential in all of this and there's need to be more research, some say this stuff works, other day it doesn't. The scientific community is still a mixed bag. So we need more time, if we even have more time that is. But that is how science works. Time is needed. 

Lowering the demand for meat is good but as long there are still people out there who demand for meat, I would prefer production through those methods, then CFOs, etc. You can't just get everyone to stop eating or demanding for meat. I would even prefer it to be more local or niche because that means that meat didn't have to travel hundreds of miles to get to your table or store etc. I understand the benefits of lower consumption completely or going vegan or vegetarian, as an Asian person I eat tons of vegetarian options. But realistically it's not ever going to go away.

Finally we can find some common ground.

These very specific conditions and ideal circumstances matter, we have the science backing up how to create them. Permaculture offers a guideline to be able to take these theoretic structures and apply them in living working ecosystems in all parts of the world already in working model systems. It is about regenerating the soil as a bottom line. 

Out of a feasibly perspective, sure its not fitting into the capitalistic structure and as such is deemd to be unscalable because profit margins are lesser drivers in the operation and become secondary. 

Again animal and crop agriculture don't have to be seperated to function well and lower emmissions. with lower emissions and in some locations with negative emission factors we know what to do if we take this knowledge into account. Nature tells us what specific conditions we have to create to achieve this outcome on a global scale. 

Doing so is up to society as a whole. Just because this type of knowledge isn't mainstreamed doesn't make it invalid or impossible. I doubt the university of Oregon actively builds their permaculture department if it doest work or wouldnt be scalable.

In marginal areas, herders have to keep moving, to avoid overgrazing. This much I agree with.

But what if Africans don’t want to live like medieval peasants, with a little sciency help, for the rest of eternity?

Everyone I’ve spoken to who was born in Africa got out because of the lack of opportunity. I know someone who hasn’t been back for years, because poverty has turned his home into a war zone – returning home for a visit, letting people notice there might be a wealthy person in the family, would expose him and his family to kidnapping risk or worse. And people would notice. Poor people notice everything, their survival depends on it.

Why is Africa like this? Look into the mirror. Our ancestors of hundreds of years ago lived in violent nations full of want and hunger, early death and misery. Kidnapping was so common one of our ancestors wrote a famous story about kidnapping, which has survived to today. If someone living in one of Africa’s trouble spots was dropped into 16th or 17th century Britain, Europe or America, I suspect the insecurity, crime and violence they encountered would all seem very familiar.

“Agroecology” isn’t going to sort out such hellish deprivation. An African industrial revolution is what is needed. Just as the Western industrial revolution saved Western countries from hunger, misery and insecurity, modern agriculture, fertiliser, pesticide, irrigation, high yields and industry is helping Africa follow in our footsteps, and will ultimately help Africans achieve Western levels of prosperity and security.

Data show that food security has improved over the past decades of warming.
